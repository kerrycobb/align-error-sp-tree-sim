Accuracy and precision of divergence time estimates, in units of expected 
subsitutions per site with 500 base pair loci. The left column shows 
estimates from \beast. The center column shows estimates from \ecoevolity using 
all sites and the right column shows estimates from \ecoevolity using a single 
SNP per locus. The top row are estimates with no violation of the model (no errors). 
Rows labelled 20\% and 40\% singleton errors are estimates from alignments from 
which singleton site patterns were changed to invariant sites with probabilities
0.2 and 0.4 respectively. Rows labelled 20\% and 40\% het errors are estimates 
from alignments from which one copy of randomly paired gene copies within each
species was replaced with the other with with probabilities 0.2 and 0.4 respectively.
Each plotted circle and associated error bars represent the posterior mean and 95\%
credible interval. Circles and error bars are colored yellow if the effective 
sample size of the estimate was less than 200, are colored red if the potential 
scale reduction factor was greater than 1.2, and are colored green if both were 
true. We generated the plots using matplotlib Version 3.1.1 \citep{matplotlib}.
