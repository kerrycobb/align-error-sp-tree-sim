\footnotesize An illsustration of the species-tree model we used to simulate
data. \rootpopsize, \tippopsize[1], and \tippopsize[2] represent the constant 
effective population sizes of the root, and each of the two terminal populations.
\divtime reperesents the instantaneous separation of the ancestral population into
two descendant populations. One hypothetical gene tree is show to illustrate the 
gene trees simulated under a contained coalescent process for 4 haploid gene 
copies sampled from each of the terminal branches of the species tree.
