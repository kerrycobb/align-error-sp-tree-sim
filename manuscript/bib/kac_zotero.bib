	abstract = {The Dobzhansky–Muller model of speciation posits that defects in hybrids between species are the result of negative epistatic interactions between alleles that arose in independent genetic backgrounds. Tests of one important prediction from this model, that incompatibilities “snowball,” have relied on comparisons of the number of incompatibilities between closely related pairs of species separated by different divergence times. How incompatibilities accumulate along phylogenies, however, remains poorly understood. We extend the Dobzhansky–Muller model to multispecies clades to describe the mathematical relationship between tree topology and the number of shared incompatibilities among related pairs of species. We use these results to develop a statistical test that distinguishes between the snowball and alternative incompatibility accumulation models, including nonepistatic and multilocus incompatibility models, in a phylogenetic context. We further demonstrate that patterns of incompatibility sharing across species pairs can be used to estimate the relative frequencies of different types of incompatibilities, including derived–derived versus derived–ancestral incompatibilities. Our results and statistical methods should motivate comparative genetic mapping of hybrid incompatibilities to evaluate competing models of speciation.},

In particular, the probability of successful speciation can be influenced by factors that affect the frequency with which population isolates form as well as their persistence through time. We suggest that population isolation and persistence have an inherently spatial dimension that can be profitably studied using a conceptual framework drawn from metapopulation ecology. We discuss models of speciation that incorporate demographic processes and highlight the need for a broader application of phylogenetic comparative approaches to evaluate the general importance of population isolation, persistence, and reproductive isolation in speciation. We review diverse and nontraditional data sources that can be leveraged to study isolation and persistence in a comparative framework. This incorporation of spatial demographic information facilitates the integration of perspectives on speciation across disciplines and timescales.},

Calumma roaloko sp. n. has a dermal rostral appendage and occipital lobes, and belongs to the C. boettgeri complex, within the Madagascar-endemic phenetic C. nasutum species group. It is readily distinguished from other species of the C. boettgeri complex by a characteristic two-toned body coloration and small body size with a snout-vent length of 45.6 mm in an adult male. The osteology of the skull, with a prominent maxilla and broad parietal, is similar to the closest related species, C. uetzi. Analysis of uncorrected genetic distances within the C. nasutum group using the mitochondrial gene ND2 shows a minimum pairwise distance of 11.98\% to C. uetzi from the Sorata massif and Marojejy National Park {\textgreater}500 km north of the type locality of C. roaloko sp. n.. Given an apparently small range (potentially {\textless}300 km2), located entirely outside of any nationally-protected areas, we recommend this new species be classified as Endangered under criterion B1ab(iii) of the IUCN Red List. The discovery of clearly distinct species like C. roaloko sp. n. in an area of Madagascar that is comparatively thoroughly surveyed highlights the critical role of continued field surveys for understanding the true extent of Madagascar’s spectacular biodiversity.},

The importance of model choice continues to grow as phylogenetic models continue to increase in complexity to better capture micro and macroevolutionary processes. In a Bayesian framework, the marginal likelihood is how data update our prior beliefs about models, which gives us an intuitive measure of comparing model ﬁt that is grounded in probability theory. Given the rapid increase in the number and complexity of phylogenetic models, methods for approximating marginal likelihoods are increasingly important. Here we try to provide an intuitive description of marginal likelihoods and why they are important in Bayesian model testing. We also categorize and review methods for estimating marginal likelihoods of phylogenetic models, highlighting several recent methods that provide well-behaved estimates. Furthermore, we review some empirical studies that demonstrate how marginal likelihoods can be used to learn about models of evolution from biological data. We discuss promising alternatives that can complement marginal likelihoods for Bayesian model choice, including posterior-predictive methods. Using simulations, we ﬁnd one alternative method based on approximate-Bayesian computation (ABC) to be biased. We conclude by discussing the challenges of Bayesian model choice and future directions that promise to improve the approximation of marginal likelihoods and Bayesian phylogenetics as a whole.},

	abstract = {Many biotic and abiotic factors that inﬂuence the distribution, abundance, and diversiﬁcation of species can simultaneously aﬀect multiple evolutionary lineages within or across communities. These include environmental changes and inter-speciﬁc ecological interactions that cause ranges of multiple, co-distributed species to contract, expand, or become fragmented. Such processes predict temporally clustered patterns of evolutionary events across species, such as synchronous population divergences and/or changes in population size. This has generated interest in developing statistical methods that infer such patterns from genetic data. There have been a number of methods developed to infer shared divergences or changes in eﬀective population size, but not both, and the latter has been limited to approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We introduce a general, full-likelihood Bayesian method that can estimate temporal clustering of an arbitrary mix of population divergences and population-size changes across taxa. We use this method to assess how well we can infer temporal patterns of shared population-size changes compared to divergences when using all the information in genomic data. We ﬁnd that estimating the timing and sharing of demographic changes is much more challenging than divergences. Even under favorable simulation conditions, the ability to infer shared demographic events is quite limited and very sensitive to prior assumptions, which is in sharp contrast to accurate, precise, and robust estimates of shared divergence times. Our results also suggest that previous estimates of co-expansion among ﬁve Alaskan populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were likely spurious, and driven by a combination of mispeciﬁed prior assumptions and the lack of information about the timing of demographic changes when invariant charcters are ignored. We conclude by discussing potential avenues to improve the estimation of synchronous demographic changes across populations.},

But before isolation is complete there is sometimes a phase of heterosis in which hybrid fitness exceeds that of the two parental species. The genetics and evolution of heterosis and postzygotic isolation have typically been studied in isolation, precluding the development of a unified theory of speciation. Here, we develop a model that incorporates both positive and negative gene interactions, and accounts for the evolution of both heterosis and postzygotic isolation. We parameterize the model with recent data on the fitness effects of 10,000 mutations in yeast, singly and in pairwise epistatic combinations. The model makes novel predictions about the types of interactions that contribute to declining hybrid fitness. We reproduce patterns familiar from earlier models of speciation (e.g. Haldane’s Rule and Darwin’s Corollary) and identify new mechanisms that may underlie these patterns. Our approach provides a general framework for integrating experimental data from gene interaction networks into speciation theory and makes new predictions about the genetic mechanisms of speciation.},

Despite strong postzygotic selection, hybridization occurs between two normally ecologically isolated toad species, the Gulf Coast Toad (Bufo nebulifer) and Fowler's Toad (Bufo fowleri). This hybridization has potentially contributed to a decline of the rarer species, B. fowleri. Putative hybrids may be morphologically cryptic; therefore, molecular methods were used to identify them. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify hybrids, and mitochondrial sequence variation in a segment of the 12S and 16S rRNA region was also used to identify maternal ancestry of hybrids and seek evidence of directional hybridization and introgression of male B. nebulifer with female B. fowleri. Seventy-two individuals of both species from nine breeding populations were directly sequenced. Twelve species-specific SNPs from a 333 base pair fragment in a nuclear intron of the Rhodopsin gene were used to identify each species, and two male hybrids were identified based on heterozygosity at these sites. The possession of a different mtDNA sequence by each hybrid indicated an alternate maternal lineage from each of the parental species and identified the hybrids as progeny from each reciprocal cross. Use of mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers allowed unambiguous identification of hybrids and their maternal parent that could not have been performed without the use of both datasets. We also investigated phylogenetic relationships among B. fowleri and its close relatives in the B. americanus species complex using mitochondrial sequence variation. Hybridization},

The two approaches recovered nearly identical phylogenetic topologies, which provide strong support for placement of A. kellogi in the debilis group, as sister taxon to the clade formed by A. debilis and A. retiformis. Species relationships within the debilis group are also well supported and concordant with aspects of earlier, morphology-based hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Understanding the general features of speciation is an important goal in evolutionary biology, and despite significant progress, several unresolved questions remain. We analyzed an extensive comparative dataset consisting of more than 1900 crosses between 92 species of toads to infer patterns of reproductive isolation. This unique dataset provides an opportunity to examine the strength of reproductive isolation, the development and sex ratios of hybrid offspring, patterns of fertility and infertility, and polyploidization in hybrids all in the context of genetic divergence between parental species. We found that the strength of intrinsic postzygotic isolation increases with genetic divergence, but relatively high levels of divergence are necessary before reproductive isolation is complete in toads. Fertilization rates were not correlated to genetic divergence, but hatching success, the number of larvae produced, and the percentage of tadpoles reaching metamorphosis were all inversely related with genetic divergence. Hybrids between species with lower levels of divergence developed to metamorphosis, while hybrids with higher levels of divergence stopped developing in gastrula and larval stages. Sex ratios of hybrid offspring were biased towards males in 70\% of crosses and biased towards females in 30\% of crosses. Hybrid females from crosses between closely related species were completely fertile, while approximately half (53\%) of hybrid males were sterile, with sterility predicted by genetic divergence. The degree of abnormal ploidy in hybrids was positively related to genetic divergence between parental species, but surprisingly, polyploidization had no effect on patterns of asymmetrical inviability. We discuss explanations for these patterns, including the role of Haldane's rule in toads and anurans in general, and suggest mechanisms generating patterns of reproductive isolation in anurans.},

	abstract = {Nonequilibrium demography impacts coalescent genealogies leaving detectable, well-studied signatures of variation. However, similar genomic footprints are also expected under models of large reproductive skew, posing a serious problem when trying to make inference. Furthermore, current approaches consider only one of the two processes at a time, neglecting any genomic signal that could arise from their simultaneous effects, preventing the possibility of jointly inferring parameters relating to both offspring distribution and population history. Here, we develop an extended Moran model with exponential population growth, and demonstrate that the underlying ancestral process converges to a time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent. However, by applying a nonlinear change of time scale-analogous to the Kingman coalescent-we find that the ancestral process can be rescaled to its time-homogeneous analog, allowing the process to be simulated quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the expected site-frequency spectrum under the time-inhomogeneous psi-coalescent, and develop an approximate-likelihood framework for the joint estimation of the coalescent and growth parameters. By means of extensive simulation, we demonstrate that both can be estimated accurately from whole-genome data. In addition, not accounting for demography can lead to serious biases in the inferred coalescent model, with broad implications for genomic studies ranging from ecology to conservation biology. Finally, we use our method to analyze sequence data from Japanese sardine populations, and find evidence of high variation in individual reproductive success, but few signs of a recent demographic expansion.},

We use mitochondrial sequences encoding ND1, tRNA(Leu(UUR)), and part of 16S to infer relationships among members of the Bufo americanus complex. Focusing on the four taxa that historically have been most problematic due to morphological similarity and hybridization in sympatry, we sample 150 individuals from multiple populations across each species' geographic range. Our evidence conflicts with previous taxonomic hypotheses that were based on ability to hybridize, geographic distribution, and call variation. First, sequences from B. fowleri do not comprise the sister clade to sequences of B. woodhousii; therefore the previous classifications of B. fowleri as sister species to, or eastern subspecies of, B. woodhousii are both called into question. Second, sequences from B. americanus are more closely related to those of B. woodhousii than to those of B. terrestris, indicating that similar advertisement call characteristics evolved independently. Third, sequences of B. fowleri are paraphyletic, with sequences of B. terrestris embedded within. Lastly, sequences from B. fowleri cluster into three distinct mitochondrial clades, with some divergences corresponding to greater than 2mya. These clades are somewhat geographically structured, suggesting divergence in allopatry during the Pleistocene. These mitochondrial divergences are not accompanied by known phenotypic differences, however, suggesting either evolutionary stasis in morphology and behavior, cryptic phenotypic evolution, or that hybridization in secondary contact has homogenized phenotypic differences that may have arisen in allopatry},

The loci did not exhibit identical clines in allele frequencies. Both morphological and genetic scores for individuals demonstrated increased individual variation within the hybrid zone. Compared to morphological evidence taken 11 or more years prior, the hybrid zone shifted westward by about 9.6 km while maintaining the same width. Fluctuating population sizes may influence such dynamics. Selection against hybrids could not be demonstrated. Interspecies taxonomic boundaries are rendered vague by hybrid zones, creating difficulties for species delineation. Because hybridization may imply only the plesiomorphic lack of isolation mechanisms, evidence that the taxa involved maintain their historic identities outside of the hybrid zone despite a restricted exchange of genes within it argues for the existence of phylogenetic species.},

Fossil evidence suggests some genomic compatibility has been retained between B. alvarius and B. woodhousii despite at least 6 million years of independent evolution.

These toads appear to belong within the Anaxyrus boreas species group but are commonly referred to as Dixie Valley toads (DVTs). The DVT is currently confined to an extremely narrow habitat range (370 ha) that is geographically isolated from any other A. boreas population. In this study, genetic variations in mitochondrial genes and 11 microsatellite loci were used to assess the affinities of DVTs in relation to members of the A. boreas species group. We compared results from DVTs with previously published data spanning much of the range of A. boreas in the United States and new data from a nearby toad population within Dixie Valley. Data from both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites placed DVTs inside the A. boreas species group. In particular, DVTs fell into a cluster of A. boreas from Washington and California, along with other species from the A. boreas species group, namely A. nelsoni, A. canorus, and A. exsul. Genetic differentiation of DVTs was lowest between A. boreas populations in Washington and California. However, allele frequencies were significantly different between DVTs and all other populations, including a nearby locality within Dixie Valley. This genetic differentiation, along with the DVT's geographical isolation and restricted habitat, warrants recognition of the DVT as a distinct management unit.},

As in all other zones of sympatry for these bufonids, behavior and morphology provide clear evidence of hybridization at a number of sites along the Virgin River. Analysis of morphology and behavior indicates that the distribution of these taxa and their hybrids is largely unchanged relative to that documented forty years ago by Blair (1955). Comparisons of morphological hybrid index scores reveal slight shifts in relative numbers of parental taxa at only one site.

We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Baupläne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

Calls were recorded from three populations of B. retiformis, two populations of B. debilis, and three populations of B. punctatus. For B. retiformis, pulse rate and dominant frequency, but not call duration, were significantly related to temperature, and dominant frequency and pulse rate, but not call duration, were negatively correlated with snout-vent length. In spite of its larger size, advertisement call frequency of B. retiformis was similar to B. debilis. The relationship (i.e, slope) between snout-vent length and frequency, and the relationship between body temperature and pulse rate, were not equivalent for these three taxa. Pulse rise time was similar in B. debilis and B. retiformis, and significantly different between these taxa and B. punctatus. In contrast to the intermediate calls typical of hybrids between cosely related bufonids, advertisement calls of a hybrid B. punctatus x B. retiformis were aberrant, but more similar to B. punctatus rather than intermediate to the parental forms. The call producing mechanisms of B. debilis and B. retiformis are not similar to B. punctatus, and in a phylogenetic context are probably plesiomorphic relative to those of B. punctatus},

	abstract = {? 2015 Portik and Papenfuss.Abstract Background: The Arabian Peninsula is home to a unique fauna that has assembled and evolved throughout the course of major geophysical events, including the separation of the Arabian Plate from Africa and subsequent collision with Eurasia. Opportunities for faunal exchanges with particular continents occurred in temporally distinct periods, and the presence of African, Western Eurasian, and South Asian derived taxa on the Arabian Peninsula signifies the complexity of these historical biogeographic events. The six true toad species (family Bufonidae) endemic to Arabian Peninsula present a considerable taxonomic and biogeographic challenge because they are part of a global bufonid radiation, including several genera surrounding the Arabian Peninsula, and difficult to discriminate morphologically. As they could be derived from African, Western Eurasian, or South Asian toad groups, elucidating their evolutionary relationships has important implications for historical biogeography. Here, we analyze a global molecular data set of 243 bufonid lineages, with an emphasis on new sampling from the Horn of Africa, Western Eurasia, South Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula, to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of the Arabian species. We produce a robust time-calibrated phylogeny to infer the biogeographic history of this group on and around the Arabian Peninsula. Results: Our phylogenetic analyses indicate two of the endemic Arabian toad species, "Bufo" tihamicus and "Bufo" arabicus, evolved independently within the African genus Amietophrynus. We confirm the Arabian species Duttaphrynus dhufarensis is of South Asian origin, but do not find evidence for the Asian genus Duttaphrynus being present in the Horn of Africa, discrediting a previously proposed Asian bufonid dispersal event to Africa. We also do not find evidence of the African genus Amietophrynus occurring in South Asia, suggesting that unlike many other vertebrate taxa, toads have not used the Arabian Peninsula as a stepping-stone for trans-continental dispersal. Our divergence dating estimates strongly suggest the formation of the Red Sea drove simultaneous divergences between two of the Arabian species (A. tihamicus comb. nov. and A. arabicus comb. nov.) and their xclosest mainland African relatives in the Early Miocene. We estimate the divergence of D. dhufarensis with its closest South Asian relatives occurred in the mid to Late Miocene, suggesting the temporary or permanent land connections between the Arabian plate and Eurasia facilitated dispersal of this lineage to the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusions: The Arabian bufonid assemblage, despite being comparatively depauperate with respect to surrounding continents, exemplifies the faunal pattern of the Arabian Peninsula, namely being a complex admixture of African, Western Eurasian, and South Asian elements. The historical biogeographic patterns exhibited by Arabian toads and their allies are concordant with studies of other vertebrate taxa, building support for the role of major geological events in driving simultaneous vicariance and dispersal events around the Arabian Peninsula. Although many taxa or groups exhibiting disjunct Afro-Arabian distributions appear to have dispersed more recently from the Horn of Africa via a southern land bridge or overwater dispersal, both Amietophrynus tihamicus and A. arabicus likely represent true African relicts resulting from vicariance associated with the Red Sea formation, a pattern that so far is rare among the vertebrate species investigated.},

Discriminant analysis of variation in 27 morphological characters from 286 preserved museum specimens of male toads and putative hybrids was compared with previous allozyme genetic characterization of the same specimens. Reference samples from allopatric populations were used for comparison. Bufo americanus from Long Point were significantly different from other samples of the same species, demonstrating introgression in the direction of sympatric B. fowleri. Long-term hybridization in this region has been confined to Long Point despite sympatry elsewhere. Thus, the hybrid zone between these toads does not conform to gradient or "tension zone" models. Rather, it is a mosaic in that hybrids appear at some times and in some places but not in others and it conforms to the concept of a "localized sympatric" hybrid zone.},

Phylogenetic analyses of the mtDNA 12S rDNA, cytochrome oxidase I, control region, and restriction sites data, identified three major haplotype clades. The Northwest clade (NW) includes both subspecies of A. boreas and divergent minor clades in the middle Rocky Mountains, coastal, and central regions of the west and Pacific Northwest. The Southwest (SW) clade includes A. exsul, A. nelsoni, and minor clades in southern California. Anaxyrus canorus, previously identified as paraphyletic, has populations in both the NW and SW major clades. The Eastern major clade (E) includes three divergent lineages from southern Utah, the southern Rocky Mountains, and north of the Great Basin at the border of Utah and Nevada. These results identify new genetic variation in the eastern portion of the toad's range and are consistent with previous regional studies from the west coast. Low levels of control region sequence divergence between major clades (2.2-4.7\% uncorrected pair-wise distances) are consistent with Pleistocene divergence and suggest that the phylogeographic history of the group was heavily influenced by dynamic Pleistocene glacial and climatic changes, and especially pluvial changes, in western North America.

The South American lineage likely diverged from the Central and North American lineages in the Eocene; the latter two lineages diverged later, probably in the mid-Oligocene.

Boophis boppa sp. nov. is part of the B. ankaratra sub-clade (herein named the B. ankaratra complex), previously identified within the monophyletic B. albipunctatus species group. It occurs sympatrically with two other species of the complex (B. ankaratra and B. schuboeae). Morphological differentiation of species within the B. ankaratra clade remains elusive, but species are well characterized by distinct advertisement calls, with B. boppa having the longest note duration and inter-note intervals when compared to closely related species. Furthermore, it has moderate differentiation in mitochondrial DNA, with pairwise distances of 1.9-3.7\% to all other species in sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA marker. Additional evidence is given by the lack of haplotype sharing with related species for the nuclear exon DNAH-3. All examples of syntopic occurrence in this complex involve species with strongly different advertisement calls, while allopatric species have more similar calls. Such a pattern might result from adaptive call co-evolution but could also be the result of non-adaptive processes. Thorough clarification of the systematics of the B. ankaratra sub-clade is required, and we outline future directions for both bioacoustic and genetic research.},

Support for species-level identifications and for the identification of traditionally recognized species groups based on ilial characters alone was assessed.Results indicate that no distinctive morphologies in the ilium of extant North American Bufo are known that permit a species-level identification or the diagnosis of any traditionally recognized species group. Two of the ten included extinct species, B. holmani and B. kihrei, do contain ilial characters that fall outside the observed range of the examined extant species. The fact that both morphometric and discrete characters fail to support species-level identification of isolated ilia of extant Bufo indicates that identifications should be restricted to higher taxonomic levels until new ilial characters are established. Potentially informative characters should be tested against a comparative sample that reflects clade diversity rather than one that reflects our geographic and/or temporal assumptions. This approach helps to avoid circularity if the identifications are used subsequently in analyses of faunal dynamics.},

Two microevolutionary processes can take place in hybrid zones, with opposing effects on population differentiation. Hybridization tends to produce genetic homogenization, reducing species differences, whereas the presence of mechanisms of reproductive isolation result in barriers to gene flow, maintaining or increasing differences between taxa. RESULTS Here we study a contact zone between two hybridizing toad species, Bufo bufo and B. spinosus, through a combination of molecular (12 polymorphic microsatellites, four nuclear and two mitochondrial SNP markers) and morphological data in a transect in the northwest of France. The results show largely concordant clines across markers, defining a narrow hybrid zone of ca. 30 km wide. Most hybrids in the centre of the contact zone are classified as F2 or backcrossed individuals, with no individuals assigned to the F1 hybrid class. CONCLUSIONS We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the evolutionary history of these species. We anticipate that the toad contact zone here described will become an important asset in the study of hybrid zone dynamics and evolutionary biology because of its easy access and the abundance of the species involved.},

Directional introgression probably occurred between the males of B. torrenticola and females possessing the mtDNA of B. j. formosus, resulting from B. j. formosus being compelled to spawn in stream side pools, especially during the initial period of contact between the two species. Furthermore, most of the hybrid individuals probably backcrossed to the numerically predominant B. torrenticola. Such conditions might have resulted from recent and continuous flooding which created changes in the topography of the Bufo spawning habitat.},

	abstract = {Initiation of breeding activity of Bufo houstonensis followed a rise in minimum air temperature in January or February to above approximately 14°C. Rain was not a direct necessary stimulus to breeding in this species; additional site-specific stimuli apparently are necessary; rapid algal growth may be such a stimulus. Amplectant male B. houstonensis were significantly larger than non-amplectant males. Based on growth data from recaptured males, it is likely that older male B. houstonensis are more likely to achieve amplexus than are first-season males. Data on breeding behavior and movements to and from breeding sites are presented. Natural hybrids between B. houstonensis and B. woodhousei and between B. houstonensis and B. valliceps were identified morphologically and electrophoretically. Only one suspected backcross product was found. Hybridization among these species was minimal in the study areas–in all cases less than 1\% of the parental populations. The primary isolating mechanisms are temporally offset breeding seasons (of B. houstonensis and B. valliceps) and habitat isolation (B. houstonensis and B. woodhousei). The population sizes of B. houstonensis in Bastrop Co., Texas, are larger than previously reported; present population sizes in this area appear not to be critically low. The restricted range of the species coupled with habitat destruction seem to be the primary factors in the endangerment of B. houstonensis.

	abstract = {A classic problem in population genetics is the characterization of discrete population structure in the presence of continuous patterns of genetic differentiation. Especially when sampling is discontinuous, the use of clustering or assignment methods may incorrectly ascribe differentiation due to continuous processes (e.g., geographic isolation by distance) to discrete processes, such as geographic, ecological, or reproductive barriers between populations. This reflects a shortcoming of current methods for inferring and visualizing population structure when applied to genetic data deriving from geographically distributed populations. Here, we present a statistical framework for the simultaneous inference of continuous and discrete patterns of population structure. The method estimates ancestry proportions for each sample from a set of two-dimensional population layers, and, within each layer, estimates a rate at which relatedness decays with distance. This thereby explicitly addresses the "clines versus clusters" problem in modeling population genetic variation, and remedies some of the overfitting to which nonspatial models are prone. The method produces useful descriptions of structure in genetic relatedness in situations where separated, geographically distributed populations interact, as after a range expansion or secondary contact. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using simulations and by applying it to empirical datasets of poplars and black bears in North America.},

Whether the same process governs lineage accumulation and trait disparity during continental colonization events is less clear. Here, we test this prediction by investigating the rate dynamics and trait evolution of one of Africa's most widespread amphibian colonizers, the true toads (Bufonidae). By reconstructing the most complete molecular phylogeny of African Bufonidae to date, we find that the diversification of lineages in Africa best conforms to a constant rate model throughout time and across subclades, with little support for EO. Evolutionary rates of life-history traits have similarly been constant over time. However, an analysis of generalists and specialists showed a shift toward higher speciation rates associated with habitat specialization. The overall lack of EO signal can be interpreted in a number of ways and we propose several explanations. Firstly, methodological issues might preclude the detection of EO. Secondly, colonizers might not experience true EO conditions and due to the size, ecological heterogeneity and age of landmasses, the diversification processes might be more complex. Thirdly, lower speciation rates of habitat generalists may have affected overall proliferation of lineages.},

However, its impact on techniques that use restriction site associated next-generation DNA sequencing (RADSeq, GBS) is unknown. We experimentally examined the effects of in situDNA degradation on data generation for a modified double-digest RADSeq approach (3RAD). We generated libraries using genomic DNA serially extracted from the muscle tissue of 8 individual lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) following 0-, 12-, 48- and 96-h incubation at room temperature posteuthanasia. This treatment of the tissue resulted in input DNA that ranged in quality from nearly intact to highly sheared. All samples were sequenced as a multiplexed pool on an Illumina MiSeq. Libraries created from low to moderately degraded DNA (12-48 h) performed well. In contrast, the number of RADtags per individual, number of variable sites, and percentage of identical RADtags retained were all dramatically reduced when libraries were made using highly degraded DNA (96-h group). This reduction in performance was largely due to a significant and unexpected loss of raw reads as a result of poor quality scores. Our findings remained consistent after changes in restriction enzymes, modified fold coverage values (2- to 16-fold), and additional read-length trimming. We conclude that starting DNA quality is an important consideration for RADSeq; however, the approach remains robust until genomic DNA is extensively degraded.},

	abstract = {Restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing and related methods rely on the conservation of enzyme recognition sites to isolate homologous DNA fragments for sequencing, with the consequence that mutations disrupting these sites lead to missing information. There is thus a clear expectation for how missing data should be distributed, with fewer loci recovered between more distantly related samples. This observation has led to a related expectation: that RAD-seq data are insufficiently informative for resolving deeper scale phylogenetic relationships. Here we investigate the relationship between missing information among samples at the tips of a tree and information at edges within it. We re-analyze and review the distribution of missing data across ten RAD-seq data sets and carry out simulations to determine expected patterns of missing information. We also present new empirical results for the angiosperm clade Viburnum (Adoxaceae, with a crown age {\textbackslash}textgreater50 Ma) for which we examine phylogenetic information at different depths in the tree and with varied sequencing effort. The total number of loci, the proportion that are shared, and phylogenetic informativeness varied dramatically across the examined RAD-seq data sets. Insufficient or uneven sequencing coverage accounted for similar proportions of missing data as dropout from mutation-disruption. Simulations reveal that mutation-disruption, which results in phylogenetically distributed missing data, can be distinguished from the more stochastic patterns of missing data caused by low sequencing coverage. In Viburnum, doubling sequencing coverage nearly doubled the number of parsimony informative sites, and increased by {\textbackslash}textgreater10X the number of loci with data shared across {\textbackslash}textgreater40 taxa.

	abstract = {The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that the amount of neutral polymorphisms within a species will increase proportionally with the census population size (Nc). However, this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range. Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this hypothesis have been conducted. In this work, we provide a direct test of this hypothesis using population genomic data from a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. To do this, we relied on the fact that the impact of natural selection on linked neutral diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. In regions of relatively low recombination, selected variants affect more neutral sites through linkage, and the resulting correlation between recombination and polymorphism allows a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the impact of selection on linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole genome polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling framework, we estimate the degree to which natural selection reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the impact of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc, based on body size and species range as proxies for census population size. These results demonstrate that natural selection removes more variation at linked neutral sites in species with large Nc than those with small Nc and provides direct empirical evidence that natural selection constrains levels of neutral genetic diversity across many species. This implies that natural selection may provide an explanation for this longstanding paradox of population genetics.},

	abstract = {Aim The species-rich family of true toads (Anura: Bufonidae) has been the focus of several earlier studies investigating the biogeography of geographically widespread taxa. Herein, we employ newly developed Bayesian divergence estimate methods to investigate the biogeographical history of this group. Resulting age estimates are used to test several key temporal hypotheses including that the origin of the bufonid clade pre-dates Gondwanan vicariance (similar to 105 million years ago, Ma). Area cladograms are also invoked to investigate the geographical origin of the family. Location Worldwide, except the Australia-New Guinea plate, Madagascar and the Antarctic. Methods A phylogenetic hypothesis of the relationships among true toads was derived from analysis of 2521 bp of DNA data including fragments from three mitochondrial (12S, tRNA(val), 16S) and two nuclear (RAG-1, CXCR-4) genes. Analysis of multiple, unlinked loci with a Bayesian method for estimating divergence times allowed us to address the timing and biogeographical history of Bufonidae. Resulting divergence estimates permitted the investigation of alternative vicariance/dispersal scenarios that have been proposed for true toads. Results Our area cladogram resulting from phylogenetic analysis of DNA data supports a South American origin for Bufonidae. Divergence estimates indicate that the family originated earlier than had been suggested previously (78-99 Ma). The age of the enigmatic Caribbean clade was dated to the late Palaeocene-early Eocene. A return of bufonids to the New World in the Eocene was followed by rapid diversification and secondary expansion into South America by the early Oligocene (Rupelian). Main conclusions The South American origin of Bufonidae in the Upper Cretaceous was followed by relatively rapid expansion and radiation around the globe, ending with a return to the Americas via a Eurasian/North American land bridge in the Eocene. Though the exact route of this dispersal (Beringia or North Atlantic) remains unclear, an argument is made for the less frequently invoked North Atlantic connection. The origin of the enigmatic Caribbean lineage was found to be consistent with colonization following the bolide impact at the K/T boundary. These findings provide the first, firm foundation for understanding true toad divergence times and their truly remarkable and global radiation.},

	abstract = {A comparative morphological study of 42 species of the African tribe Nothobranchiini provided 138 characters that, combined with available DNA sequences (3327 bp), highly supported monophyly of the tribe, making it possible to generate the first unambiguous diagnoses for included genera (Fundulosoma, Pronothobranchius and Nothobranchius). The analyses corroborate Fundulosoma as the sister group to a clade containing all other Nothobranchiini. This study first reports a broad diversification of jaw and branchial structures in Nothobranchius, the most diverse aplocheiloid genus, traditionally divided into subgenera. Six subgenera are recognized (Adiniops, Cynobranchius subgen. nov., Nothobranchius, Paranothobranchius, Plesiobranchius subgen. nov. and Zononothobranchius). Cynobranchius is erected for a clade of deep-bodied, zooplankton-feeding species, diagnosed by 16 morphological synapomorphies, of which nine are probably related to their specialized feeding habits. The clade containing Cynobranchius and the monotypic subgenus Plesiobranchius is supported as the sister group to a clade containing all other subgenera of Nothobranchius. Paranothobranchius, comprising the largest aplocheiloid species, is diagnosed by 17 apomorphic conditions, most of them related to specialized piscivorous habits. However, this study indicates that predator jaw morphology arose independently three times in Nothobranchius. Aphyobranchius, formerly including specialized surface-dwelling species, is considered to be a synonym of Adiniops. ADDITIONAL},

	abstract = {Interspecific hybridization is widespread and frequent among frogs and toads. Hybrids are not abnormalities but are the normal results of particular kinds of genetic interactions. Hybrid zones in the form of steep clines may appear where two differentiated populations contact each other, frequently in association with an environmental gradient, but hybrids also occur among otherwise genetically independent sympatric populations. Hybrid interactions among the members of the Bufo americanus group of toads illustrate taxonomic difficulties engendered by competing interpretations. Hybrid zones in the form of clines between parapatric species have been used as evidence to synonymize taxa, yet sympatric hybrid zones between other related species have not. Examples of both kinds of hybrid zones in toads exhibit temporal dynamics and the range of hybrid interactions is best viewed as a continuum of differentiation. Taxa which hybridize have vague borders since hybrids transgress the boundaries of species taxa. Natural hybridization poses a problem for taxonomic practice because it cannot be accommodated by the Linnaean system that relies upon two-valued Aristotelian logic when addressing questions of categorical species membership. Continuous-valued (fuzzy) logic provides an underpinning for rigorous description of the boundaries of species where hybridization renders them obscure.},

Two biogeographic hypotheses are tested to explain the current distribution of these species, based on a calibrated rate of evolution and the percent sequence divergence between the two species.

	abstract = {Natural hybridization among recently diverged species has traditionally been viewed as a homogenizing force, but recent research has revealed a possible role for interspecific gene flow in facilitating species radiations. Natural hybridization can actually contribute to radiations by introducing novel genes or reshuffling existing genetic variation among diverging species. Species that have been affected by natural hybridization often demonstrate patterns of discordance between phylogenies generated using nuclear and mitochondrial markers. We used Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) data in conjunction with mitochondrial DNA in order to examine patterns of gene flow and nuclear-mitochondrial discordance in the Anaxyrus americanus group, a recent radiation of North American toads. We found high levels of gene flow between putative species, particularly in species pairs sharing similar male advertisement calls that occur in close geographic proximity, suggesting that prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms and isolation by distance are the primary determinants of gene flow and genetic differentiation among these species. Additionally, phylogenies generated using AFLP and mitochondrial data were markedly discordant, likely due to recent and/or ongoing natural hybridization events between sympatric populations. Our results indicate that the putative species in the A. americanus group have experienced high levels of gene flow, and suggest that their North American radiation could have been facilitated by the introduction of beneficial genetic variation from admixture between divergent populations coming into secondary contact after glacial retreats. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Phylogenetic analyses provided strong support for three major lineages within A. punctatus. Each lineage broadly corresponded to one of three desert regions. Early speciation in A. punctatus appeared linked to late Miocene-Pliocene development of the Baja California peninsula. This event was likely followed by a Pleistocene divergence associated with the separation of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts.

However, researchers often find the existing methods expensive to initiate and/or difficult to implement consistently, especially due to the inability to highly-multiplex samples to fill entire sequencing lanes. Here, we introduce a low-cost and highly robust approach for the construction of dual-digest RADseq libraries that relies on adapters and primers designed in \textit{Adapterama I}. Major features of our method include: 1) minimizing the number of processing steps; 2) focusing on a single strand of sample DNA for library construction, allowing the use of a non-phosphorylated adapter on one end; 3) ligating adapters in the presence of active restriction enzymes, thereby reducing chimeras; 4) including an optional third restriction enzyme to cut apart adapter-dimers formed by the phosphorylated adapter, thus increasing the efficiency of adapter ligation to sample DNA, which is particularly effective when only low quantity/quality DNA samples are available; 5) interchangeable adapter designs; 6) incorporating variable-length internal indexes within the adapters to increase the scope of sample indexing, facilitate pooling, and increase sequence diversity; 7) maintaining compatibility with universal dual-indexed primers and thus, Illumina sequencing reagents and libraries; and, 8) easy modification for the identification of PCR duplicates. We present eight adapter designs that work with 72 restriction enzyme combinations. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by comparing it with existing methods, and we validate its utility through the discovery of many variable loci in a variety of non-model organisms. Our 2RAD/3RAD method is easy to perform, has low startup costs, has increased utility with low-concentration input DNA, and produces libraries that can be highly-multiplexed and pooled with other Illumina libraries.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this review, we describe and compare different model-based statistical methods used to infer genetic ancestry. We describe the conceptual and mathematical structure of these models and highlight some of their key differences and shared features. We then discuss recent empirical studies that use estimates of genetic ancestry to analyse population histories, the nature and genetic basis of species boundaries, and the genetic architecture of traits. These diverse studies demonstrate the breadth of applications that rely on genetic ancestry estimates and typify the genomics-enabled research that is becoming increasingly common in molecular ecology.

This model quantifies locus-specific patterns of introgression with two cline parameters that describe the probability of locus-specific ancestry as a function of genome-wide admixture. ‘Outlier’ loci with extreme patterns of introgression relative to most of the genome can be identified. These loci are potentially associated with adaptive divergence or reproductive isolation. We simulated genetic data for admixed populations that included neutral introgression, as well as loci that were subject to directional, epistatic or underdominant selection, and analysed these data using the Bayesian genomic cline model. Under many demographic conditions, underdominance or directional selection had detectable and predictable effects on cline parameters, and ‘outlier’ loci were greatly enriched for genetic regions affected by selection. We also analysed previously published genetic data from two transects through a hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and M. musculus. We found considerable variation in rates of introgression across the genome and particularly low rates of introgression for two X-linked markers. There were similarities and differences in patterns of introgression between the two transects, which likely reflects a combination of stochastic variability because of genetic drift and geographic variation in the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. By providing a robust framework to quantify and compare patterns of introgression among genetic regions and populations, the Bayesian genomic cline model will advance our understanding of the genetics of reproductive isolation and the speciation process.},

	abstract = {Understanding factors regulating hybrid ﬁtness and gene exchange is a major research challenge for evolutionary biology. Genomic cline analysis has been used to evaluate alternative patterns of introgression, but only two models have been used widely and the approach has generally lacked a hypothesis testing framework for distinguishing effects of selection and drift. I propose two alternative cline models, implement multivariate outlier detection to identify markers associated with hybrid ﬁtness, and simulate hybrid zone dynamics to evaluate the signatures of different modes of selection. Analysis of simulated data shows that previous approaches are prone to false positives (multinomial regression) or relatively insensitive to outlier loci affected by selection (Barton’s concordance). The new, theory-based logit-logistic cline model is generally best at detecting loci affecting hybrid ﬁtness. Although some generalizations can be made about different modes of selection, there is no one-to-one correspondence between pattern and process. These new methods will enhance our ability to extract important information about the genetics of reproductive isolation and hybrid ﬁtness. However, much remains to be done to relate statistical patterns to particular evolutionary processes.

In well-connected systems, local disturbance of individual nodes can be countered by input from neighbouring nodes, buffering the system against local change. Thus, pronounced change in a well-connected system may not occur until the system hits a threshold or ‘tipping point’ that drives a shift to an alternative, system-wide state. In contrast, poorly connected systems are more prone to gradual node-by-node change. We use forward-in-time simulations of multi-locus evolution to test these general predictions concerning complex systems. We do so in the context of local adaptation in patchy environments comprised of many demes (i.e., nodes) of two habitat types. We vary connectivity by manipulating migration rate and the spatial clustering of habitat types. We find gradual and ‘deme-by-deme’ dynamics of local adaptation when connectivity is low. The dynamics transition towards more sudden, system-wide shifts as population connectivity is increased (i.e., many demes adapt more suddenly and simultaneously). Our results support a trade-off between local and system-wide resilience, and we discuss their implications for the conservation of species living in patchy and fragmented habitats.},

A collecting protocol was developed in which crickets were sampled from characteristic habitats on either side of the hybrid zone and from two distinct habitat types within the zone. Presumptive pure Gryllus pennsylvanicus were sampled from fields in northwestern Connecticut and represent "inland" populations. "Pure" Gryllusfirmus were sampled from beaches along the coast and represent the "coastal" populations. Crickets from within the hybrid zone were sampled from two different soil types: the "loam" populations from loamy soils and the "sand" populations from sandy soils. Moreover, an attempt was made to identify closely adjacent sand and loam localities to determine the scale of habitat variation and its possible effects on hybrid-zone structure. In general, there was little variation in morphological traits or in allozyme and mtDNA genotype frequencies among localities from within each ofthe four habitat types. Between each of the closely situated sand and loam localities within the hybrid zone, however, there were very significant differences in each of these sets of markers. In addition, crickets from hybrid-zone populations were tested for reproductive isolation. The asymmetric outcome of hybrid crosses that exists across the zone (Harrison, 1983) also exists on a finer ecologicalscale within the zone. Thus, this hybrid zone is a mosaic of strikingly differentiated populations. The dynamics of hybrid zones with mosaic structures are discussed in contrast to the traditional clinal models. The data are also discussed in light ofthe semipermeable nature ofspecies boundaries. The extent to which a species boundary is permeable varies not only from one genetic marker to the next, but also with the ecological and geographic context of species interaction.},

	abstract = {Hybrids between species provide information about the evolutionary processes involved in divergence. In addition to creating hybrids in the laboratory, biologists can take advantage of natural hybrid zones to understand the factors that shape gene ﬂow between divergent lineages. In the early stages of speciation, most regions of the genome continue to ﬂow freely between populations. Alternatively, the subset of the genome that confers reproductive barriers between nascent species is expected to reject introgression. Now enabled by advances in genomics, this perspective is motivating detailed comparisons of gene ﬂow across genomic regions in hybrid zones. Here, I review methods for measuring and interpreting introgression at multiple loci in hybrid zones, focusing on the problem of identifying loci that contribute to reproductive isolation. Emerging patterns from multi-locus studies of hybrid zones are highlighted, including remarkable variance in introgression across the genome. Although existing methods have been useful, there is scope for development of new analytical approaches that better connect differential patterns of gene ﬂow in hybrid zones with current knowledge of speciation mechanisms. I outline future prospects for differential introgression studies on a genomic scale.},

	abstract = {Regional phylogeographical studies involving co-distributed animal and plant species have been conducted for several areas, most notably for Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America. Until recently, phylogeographical studies in unglaciated eastern North America have been largely limited to animals. As more studies emerge for diverse lineages (including plants), it seems timely to assess the phylogeography across this region: (i) comparing and contrasting the patterns seen in plants and animals; (ii) assessing the extent of pseudocongruence; and (iii) discussing the potential applications of regional phylogeography to issues in ecology, such as response to climatic change. Unglaciated eastern North America is a large, geologically and topographically complex area with the species examined having diverse distributions. Nonetheless, some recurrent patterns emerge: (i) maritime — Atlantic vs. Gulf Coast; (ii) Apalachicola River discontinuity; (iii) Tombigbee River discontinuity; (iv) the Appalachian Mountain discontinuity; (v) the Mississippi River discontinuity; and (vi) the Apalachicola River and Mississippi River discontinuities. Although initially documented in animals, most of these patterns are also apparent in plants, providing support for phylogeographical generalizations. These patterns may generally be attributable to isolation and differentiation during Pleistocene glaciation, but in some cases may be older (Pliocene). Molecular studies sometimes agree with longstanding hypotheses of glacial refugia, but also suggest additional possible refugia, such as the southern Appalachian Mountains and areas close to the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Many species exhibit distinct patterns that reflect the unique, rather than the shared, aspects of species’ phylogeographical histories. Furthermore, similar modern phylogeographical patterns can result from different underlying causal factors operating at different times (i.e. pseudocongruence). One underemphasized component of pseudocongruence may result from the efforts of researchers to categorize patterns visually — similar patterns may, in fact, not fully coincide, and inferring agreement may obscure the actual patterns and lead to erroneous conclusions. Our modelling analyses indicate no clear spatial patterning and support the hypothesis that phylogeographical structure in diverse temperate taxa is complex and was not shaped by just a few barriers.},

Here we investigate reproductive barriers between a recently recognized hybrid bird species, the Italian sparrow Passer italiae and its parent species, the house sparrow P. domesticus and Spanish sparrow P. hispaniolensis. Reproductive barriers can be difficult to study in hybrid species due to lack of geographical contact between taxa. However, the Italian sparrow lives parapatrically with the house sparrow and both sympatrically and parapatrically with the Spanish sparrow. Through whole-transcriptome sequencing of six individuals of each of the two parent species we identified a set of putatively parent species-diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. After filtering for coverage, genotyping success (.97\%) and multiple SNPs per gene, we retained 86 species-informative, genic, nuclear and mitochondrial SNP markers from 84 genes for analysis of 612 male individuals. We show that a disproportionately large number of sex-linked genes, as well as the mitochondria and nuclear genes with mitochondrial function, exhibit sharp clines at the boundaries between the hybrid and the parent species, suggesting a role for mito-nuclear and sex-linked incompatibilities in forming reproductive barriers. We suggest that genomic conflict via interactions between mitochondria and sex-linked genes with mitochondrial function (‘‘mother’s curse’’) at one boundary and centromeric drive at the other may best explain our findings. Hybrid speciation in the Italian sparrow may therefore be influenced by mechanisms similar to those involved in non-hybrid speciation, but with the formation of two geographically separated species boundaries instead of one. Spanish sparrow alleles at some loci have spread north to form reproductive barriers with house sparrows, while house sparrow alleles at different loci, including some on the same chromosome, have spread in the opposite direction to form barriers against Spanish sparrows.},

Here we analyze genomic heterogeneity of genetic differentiation and introgression in a hybrid zone between two bird species (Manacus candei and M. vitellinus) using 59 100 SNPs, a whole genome assembly, and Bayesian models. Measures of genetic differentiation (FST) and introgression (genomic cline center [a] and rate [b]) were highly heterogeneous among loci. We identiﬁed thousands of loci with elevated parameter estimates, some of which are likely to be associated with variation in ﬁtness in Manacus populations. To analyze the genomic organization of differentiation and introgression, we mapped SNPs onto a draft assembly of the M. vitellinus genome. Estimates of FST, a, and b were autocorrelated at very short physical distances ({\textless} 100 bp), but much less so beyond this. In addition, average statistical associations (linkage disequilibrium) between SNPs were generally low and were not higher in admixed populations than in populations of the parental species. Although they did not occur with a constant probability across the genome, loci with elevated FST, a, and b were not strongly co-localized in the genome. Contrary to verbal models that predict clustering of loci involved in adaptation and isolation in discrete genomic regions, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic regions involved in adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation are scattered throughout the genome. We also found that many loci were characterized by both exceptional genetic differentiation and introgression, consistent with the hypothesis that loci involved in isolation are also often characterized by a history of divergent selection. However, the concordance between isolation and differentiation was only partial, indicating a complex architecture and history of loci involved in isolation.},

Here we used a combination of traditional and next generation genotyping techniques to test for the parallel divergence of plants from the Senecio lautus complex, a phenotypically variable groundsel that has adapted to disparate environments in the South Paciﬁc. Phylogenetic analysis of a broad selection of Senecio species showed that members of the S. lautus complex form a distinct lineage that has diversiﬁed recently in Australasia. An inspection of thousands of polymorphisms in the genome of 27 natural populations from the S. lautus complex in Australia revealed a signal of strong genetic structure independent of habitat and phenotype. Additionally, genetic differentiation between populations was correlated with the geographical distance separating them, and the genetic diversity of populations strongly depended on geographical location. Importantly, coastal forms appeared in several independent phylogenetic clades, a pattern that is consistent with the parallel evolution of these forms. Analyses of the patterns of genomic differentiation between populations further revealed that adjacent populations displayed greater genomic heterogeneity than allopatric populations and are differentiated according to variation in soil composition. These results are consistent with a process of parallel ecotypic divergence in face of gene ﬂow.},

Inland and coastal populations of the North American swamp sparrow have become an emerging model system for studies of natural selection because they are morphologically and behaviourally distinct despite a very recent divergence time ({\textless}15,000 years), yet common garden experiments have demonstrated a genetic basis for their phenotypic differences. We characterized genomic patterns of variation within and between inland and coastal swamp sparrows via reduced representation sequencing in order to reconstruct the contributions of demography, gene flow and selection to this case of recent adaptive divergence. Compared to inland swamp sparrows, coastal swamp sparrows exhibited fewer polymorphic sites and reduced nucleotide diversity at those sites, indicating that a bottleneck and/or recent selective sweeps occurred in that population during coastal colonization and local adaptation. Estimates of genome-wide differentiation (FST=0.02) and sequence divergence (ΦST=0.05) between inland and coastal populations were very low, consistent with postglacial divergence. A small number of SNPs were strongly differentiated (max FST=0.8) suggesting selection at linked sites. Swamp sparrows sampled from breeding sites at the habitat transition between freshwater and brackish marshes exhibited high levels of genetic admixture. Such evidence of active contemporary gene flow makes the evolution and maintenance of local adaptation in these two populations even more notable. We summarize several features of the swamp sparrow system that may facilitate the maintenance of adaptive diversity despite gene flow, including the presence of a magic trait.},

However, hybrid zones can form when these barriers are not complete, especially when lineages come into contact in intermediate or modified habitats. We examine a hybrid zone between two closely related riverine turtle species, Sternotherus depressus and S. peltifer, and use dual‐digest RAD sequencing to understand how this hybrid zone formed and elucidate genomic patterns of reproductive isolation. First, the geographical extent and timing of formation of the hybrid zone is established to provide context for understanding the role of extrinsic and intrinsic reproductive isolating mechanisms in this system. The strength of selection on taxon‐specific contributions to maintenance of the hybrid zone is then inferred using a Bayesian genomic cline model. These analyses identify a role for selection inhibiting introgression in some genomic regions at one end of the hybrid zone and promoting introgression in many loci at the other. When selective pressures necessary to generate outliers to the genomic cline are considered with the geographical and temporal context of this hybrid zone, we conclude that habitat‐specific selection probably limits introgression from S. depressus to S. peltifer in the direction of river flow. However, selection is mediating rapid, unidirectional introgression from S. peltifer to S. depressus, which is probably facilitated by anthropogenic habitat alteration. These findings indicate a potentially imminent threat of population‐level genomic extinction for an already imperiled species due to ongoing human‐caused habitat alteration.},

We used thousands of nuclear loci to study genomic differentiation between two lineages that have experienced recent secondary contact following isolation, and incorporated sampling from a zone of secondary contact to identify loci that are resistant to gene flow in hybrids. Comparisons of patterns of divergence and introgression revealed a positive relationship between allelic differentiation and resistance to introgression across the genome, and greater-­ than-­expected overlap between genes linked to lineage-s­ pecific divergence and loci that resist introgression. Genes linked to putatively selected markers were related to prominent aspects of rattlesnake biology that differ between populations of Western Diamondback rattlesnakes (i.e., venom and reproductive phenotypes). We also found evidence for selection against introgression of genes that may contribute to cytonuclear incompatibility, consistent with previously observed biased patterns of nuclear and mitochondrial alleles suggestive of partial reproductive isolation due to cytonuclear incompatibilities.

Such analysis is particularly powerful when applied to multiple pairs of hybridizing species, as patterns of genomic differentiation can then be related to age of the hybridizing species, providing a view into the build-up of differentiation over time. We examined 33 809 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three hybridizing woodpecker species: Red-breasted, Red-naped and Yellowbellied sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus ruber, Sphyrapicus nuchalis and Sphyrapicus varius), two of which (ruber and nuchalis) are much more closely related than each is to the third (varius). To identify positions of SNPs on chromosomes, we developed a localization method based on comparative genomics. We found narrow clines, bimodal distributions of hybrid indices and genomic regions with decreased rates of introgression. These results suggest moderately strong reproductive isolation among species and selection against speciﬁc hybrid genotypes. We found 19 small regions of strong differentiation between species, partly shared among species pairs, but no large regions of differentiation. An association analysis revealed a single strong-effect candidate locus associated with plumage, possibly explaining mismatch among the three species in genomic relatedness and plumage similarity. Our comparative analysis of species pairs of different age and their hybrid zones showed that moderately strong reproductive isolation can occur with little genomic differentiation, but that reproductive isolation is incomplete even with much greater genomic differentiation, implying there are long periods of time when hybridization is possible if diverging populations are in geographic contact.},

Genome scans are routinely used to explore genome-wide variation and identify highly differentiated loci that may contribute to ecological divergence, but they do not incorporate spatial, phenotypic or environmental data that might enhance outlier detection. Geographic cline analysis provides a potential framework for integrating diverse forms of data in a spatially explicit framework, but has not been used to study genome-wide patterns of divergence. Aided by a ﬁrst-draft genome assembly, we combined an FCT scan and geographic cline analysis to characterize patterns of genome-wide divergence between divergent pollination ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus. FCT analysis of 58 872 SNPs generated via RAD-seq revealed little ecotypic differentiation (mean FCT = 0.041), although a small number of loci were moderately-to-highly diverged. Consistent with our previous results from the gene MaMyb2, which contributes to differences in ﬂower colour, 130 loci have cline shapes that recapitulate the spatial pattern of trait divergence, suggesting that they may reside in or near the genomic regions that contribute to pollinator isolation. In the narrow hybrid zone between the ecotypes, extensive admixture among individuals and low linkage disequilibrium between markers indicate that most outlier loci are scattered throughout the genome, rather than being restricted to one or a few divergent regions. In addition to revealing the genomic consequences of ecological divergence in this system, we discuss how geographic cline analysis is a powerful but under-utilized framework for studying genome-wide patterns of divergence.},

	abstract = {Genomic features such as rate of recombination and differentiation have been suggested to play a role in species divergence. However, the relationship of these phenomena to functional organization of the genome in the context of reproductive isolation remains unexplored. Here, we examine genomic characteristics of the species boundaries between two house mouse subspecies (Mus musculus musculus/M. m. domesticus). These taxa form a narrow semipermeable zone of secondary contact across Central Europe. Due to the incomplete nature of reproductive isolation, gene ﬂow in the zone varies across the genome. We present an analysis of genomic differentiation, rate of recombination, and functional composition of genes relative to varying amounts of introgression. We assessed introgression using 1,316 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers, previously genotyped in hybrid populations from three transects. We found a signiﬁcant relationship between amounts of introgression and both genomic differentiation and rate of recombination with genomic regions of reduced introgression associated with higher genomic differentiation and lower rates of recombination, and the opposite for genomic regions of extensive introgression. We also found a striking functional polarization of genes based on where they are expressed in the cell. Regions of elevated introgression exhibit a disproportionate number of genes involved in signal transduction functioning at the cell periphery, among which olfactory receptor genes were found to be the most prominent group. Conversely, genes expressed intracellularly and involved in DNA binding were the most prevalent in regions of reduced introgression. We hypothesize that functional organization of the genome is an important driver of species divergence.},

Here, we describe HZAR and demonstrate its use with a sample data set from a well-studied hybrid zone in western Panama between whitecollared (Manacus candei) and golden-collared manakins (M. vitellinus). Comparisons of our results with previously published results for this hybrid zone validate the HZAR software.

	abstract = {A previous study of the hybrid zone in western Panama between white-collared (Manacus candei) and golden-collared manakins (M. vitellinus) documented the unidirectional introgression of vitellinus male secondary sexual traits across the zone. Here, we examine the hybrid zone in greater genetic and morphological detail. Statistical comparisons of clines are performed using maximum-likelihood and nonparametric bootstrap methods. Our results demonstrate that an array of six molecular and two morphometric markers agree in cline position and width. Clines for male collar and belly color are similar in width to the ﬁrst eight clines, but are shifted in position by at least ﬁve cline widths. The result is that birds in intervening populations are genetically and morphometrically very like parental candei, but males have the plumage color of parental vitellinus. Neither neutral diffusion nor nonlinearity of color scales appear to be viable explanations for the large cline shifts. Genetic dominance of vitellinus plumage traits is another potential explanation that will require breeding experiments to test. Sexual selection remains a plausible explanation for the observed introgression of vitellinus color traits in these highly dimorphic, polygynous, lek-mating birds. Two other clines, including a nondiagnostic isozyme locus, are similar in position to the main cluster of clines, but are broader in width. Thus, introgression at some loci is greater than that detected with diagnostic markers. Assuming that narrow clines are maintained by selection, variation in cline width indicates that selection is not uniform throughout the genome and that diagnostic markers are under more intense selective pressure. The traditional focus on diagnostic markers in studies of hybrid zones may therefore lead to underestimates of average introgression. This effect may be more pronounced in organisms with low levels of genetic divergence between hybridizing taxa.},

	abstract = {Background: Haldane’s Rule, the tendency for the heterogametic sex to show reduced fertility in hybrid crosses, can obscure the signal of gene flow in mtDNA between species where females are heterogametic. Therefore, it is important when studying speciation and species limits in female-heterogametic species like birds to assess the signature of gene flow in the nuclear genome as well. We studied introgression of microsatellites and mtDNA across a secondary contact zone between coastal and interior lineages of Western Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma californica) to test for a signature of Haldane’s Rule: a narrower cline of introgression in mtDNA compared to nuclear markers.
Results: Our initial phylogeographic analysis revealed that there is only one major area of contact between coastal and interior lineages and identified five genetic clusters with strong spatial structuring: Pacific Slope, Interior US, Edwards Plateau (Texas), Northern Mexico, and Southern Mexico. Consistent with predictions from Haldane’s Rule, mtDNA showed a narrower cline than nuclear markers across a transect through the hybrid zone. This result is not being driven by female-biased dispersal because neutral diffusion analysis, which included estimates of sex-specific dispersal rates, also showed less diffusion of mtDNA. Lineage-specific plumage traits were associated with nuclear genetic profiles for individuals in the hybrid zone, indicating that these differences are under genetic control.
Conclusions: This study adds to a growing list of studies that support predictions of Haldane’s Rule using cline analysis of multiple loci of differing inheritance modes, although alternate hypotheses like selection on different mtDNA types cannot be ruled out. That Haldane’s Rule appears to be operating in this system suggests a measure of reproductive isolation between the Pacific Slope and interior lineages. Based on a variety of evidence from the phenotype, ecology, and genetics, we recommend elevating three lineages to species level: A. californica (Pacific Slope); A. woodhouseii (Interior US plus Edwards Plateau plus Northern Mexico); A. sumichrasti (Southern Mexico). The distinctive Edwards Plateau population in Texas, which was monophyletic in mtDNA except for one individual, should be studied in greater detail given habitat threat.},

We evaluated the level and extent of hybridization between Crocodylus moreletii and Crocodylus acutus using genetic and morphological data on 300 crocodiles from 65 localities. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst genetic study that includes the entire historic range and sympatric zone of the two species. Contrary to expectations, Bayesian admixture proportions and maximum-likelihood estimates of hybrid indexes revealed that most sampled crocodiles were admixed and that the hybrid zone is geographically extensive, extending well beyond their historical region of sympatry. We identiﬁed a few geographically isolated, nonadmixed populations of both parental species. Hybrids do not appear to be F1s or recent backcrosses, but rather are more likely later-generation hybrids, suggesting that hybridization has been going on for several to many generations and is mostly the result of natural processes. Crocodylus moreletii is not the sister species of C. acutus, suggesting that the hybrid zone formed from secondary contact rather than primary divergence. Nonadmixed individuals from the two species were distinguishable based on morphological characters, whereas hybrids had a complex mosaic of morphological characters that hinders identiﬁcation in the wild. Very few nonadmixed C. acutus and C. moreletii populations exist in the wild. Consequently, the last nonadmixed C. moreletii populations have become critically endangered. Indeed, not only the parental species but also the naturally occurring hybrids should be considered for their potential conservation value.},

	abstract = {Hybrid zones are geographic regions where isolating barriers between divergent populations are challenged by admixture. Identifying factors that facilitate or inhibit hybridization in sympatry can illuminate the processes that maintain those reproductive barriers. We analysed patterns of hybridization and phenotypic variation across two newly discovered hybrid zones between three subspecies of barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). These subspecies differ in ventral coloration and wing length, traits that are targets of sexual and natural selection, respectively, and are associated with genome-wide differentiation in allopatry. We tested the hypothesis that the degree of divergence in these traits is associated with the extent of hybridization in secondary contact. We applied measures of population structure based on {\textgreater}23,000 SNPs to confirm that named subspecies correspond to distinct genomic clusters, and assessed coincidence between geographic clines for ancestry and phenotype. Although gene flow was ongoing across both hybrid zones and pairwise FST between subspecies was extremely low, we found striking differences in the extent of hybridization. In the more phenotypically differentiated subspecies pair, clines for ancestry, wing length and ventral coloration were steep and coincident, suggestive of strong isolation and, potentially, selection associated with phenotype. In the less phenotypically differentiated pair, gene flow and phenotypic variation occurred over a wide geographic span, indicative of weaker isolation. Traits associated with genome-wide differentiation in allopatry may thus also contribute to isolation in sympatry. We discuss potentially important additional roles for evolutionary history and ecology in shaping variation in the extent hybridization between closely related pairs of subspecies.},

	abstract = {Background: Hybridization between incipient species is expected to become progressively limited as their genetic divergence increases and reproductive isolation proceeds. Amphibian radiations and their secondary contact zones are useful models to infer the timeframes of speciation, but empirical data from natural systems remains extremely scarce. Here we follow this approach in the European radiation of tree frogs (Hyla arborea group). We investigated a natural hybrid zone between two lineages (Hyla arborea and Hyla orientalis) of Mio-Pliocene divergence ({\textasciitilde}5 My) for comparison with other hybrid systems from this group.
Results: We found concordant geographic distributions of nuclear and mitochondrial gene pools, and replicated narrow transitions ({\textasciitilde}30 km) across two independent transects, indicating an advanced state of reproductive isolation and potential local barriers to dispersal. This result parallels the situation between H. arborea and H. intermedia, which share the same amount of divergence with H. orientalis. In contrast, younger lineages show much stronger admixture at secondary contacts.
Conclusions: Our findings corroborate the negative relationship between hybridizability and divergence time in European tree frogs, where 5 My are necessary to achieve almost complete reproductive isolation. Speciation seems to progress homogeneously in this radiation, and might thus be driven by gradual genome-wide changes rather than single speciation genes. However, the timescale differs greatly from that of other well-studied amphibians. General assumptions on the time necessary for speciation based on evidence from unrelated taxa may thus be unreliable. In contrast, comparative hybrid zone analyses within single radiations such as our case study are useful to appreciate the advance of speciation in space and time.},

Using replicated transect samples collected over a 10-year interval from 2002 to 2012, we ﬁnd evidence for concerted movement of genetic clines in a plateau fence lizard hybrid zone (Sceloporus tristichus) in Arizona. Cline-ﬁtting analyses of SNP and mtDNA data both provide evidence that the hybrid zone shifted northward by approximately 2 km during the 10-year interval. For each sampling period, the mtDNA cline centre is displaced from the SNP cline centre and maintaining an introgression distance of approximately 3 km. The northward expansion of juniper trees into the Little Colorado River Basin in the early 1900s provides a plausible mechanism for hybrid zone formation and movement, and a broadscale quantiﬁcation of recent land cover change provides support for increased woody species encroachment at the southern end of the hybrid zone. However, population processes can also contribute to hybrid zone movement, and the current stability of the ecotone habitats in the centre of the hybrid zone suggests that movement could decelerate in the future.},

Stacks version 2 employs a de Bruijn graph assembler to build contigs from paired-end reads and overlap those contigs with the corresponding single-end loci. The new architecture allows all the individuals in a meta population to be considered at the same time as each RAD locus is processed. This enables a Bayesian genotype caller to provide precise SNPs, and a robust algorithm to phase those SNPs into long haplotypes –generating RAD loci that are 400-800bp in length. To prove its recall and precision, we test the software with simulated data and compare reference-aligned and de novo analyses of three empirical datasets. We show that the latest version of Stacks is highly accurate and outperforms other software in assembling and genotyping paired-end de novo datasets.},

	abstract = {Background: The dramatic progress in sequencing technologies offers unprecedented prospects for deciphering the organization of natural populations in space and time. However, the size of the datasets generated also poses some daunting challenges. In particular, Bayesian clustering algorithms based on pre-defined population genetics models such as the STRUCTURE or BAPS software may not be able to cope with this unprecedented amount of data. Thus, there is a need for less computer-intensive approaches. Multivariate analyses seem particularly appealing as they are specifically devoted to extracting information from large datasets. Unfortunately, currently available multivariate methods still lack some essential features needed to study the genetic structure of natural populations.
Results: We introduce the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), a multivariate method designed to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. When group priors are lacking, DAPC uses sequential K-means and model selection to infer genetic clusters. Our approach allows extracting rich information from genetic data, providing assignment of individuals to groups, a visual assessment of between-population differentiation, and contribution of individual alleles to population structuring. We evaluate the performance of our method using simulated data, which were also analyzed using STRUCTURE as a benchmark. Additionally, we illustrate the method by analyzing microsatellite polymorphism in worldwide human populations and hemagglutinin gene sequence variation in seasonal influenza.
Conclusions: Analysis of simulated data revealed that our approach performs generally better than STRUCTURE at characterizing population subdivision. The tools implemented in DAPC for the identification of clusters and graphical representation of between-group structures allow to unravel complex population structures. Our approach is also faster than Bayesian clustering algorithms by several orders of magnitude, and may be applicable to a wider range of datasets.},

	abstract = {A recent test for the existence of suture zones in North America, based on hybrid zones studied since 1970, found support for only two of the 13 suture zones identiﬁed by Remington in 1968 (Swenson and Howard 2004). One limitation of that recent study was the relatively small number of hybrid zones available for mapping. In this study, we search for evidence of clustering of contact zones between closely related taxa using data not only from hybrid zones but from species range maps of trees, birds, and mammals and from the position of phylogeographic breaks within species. Digital geographic range maps and a geographic information system approach allowed for accurate and rapid mapping of distributional data. Areas of contact between closely related species and phylogeographic breaks within species clustered into areas characterized by common physiographic features or predicted by previously hypothesized glacial refugia. The results underscore the general importance of geographic barriers to dispersal (mountain chains) and climate change (periods of cooling alternating with periods of warming, which lead to the contraction and expansion of species ranges) in species evolution.},

	abstract = {The ubiquity of the “two rules of speciation”—Haldane's rule and the large X‐effect —implies a general, special role for sex chromosomes in the evolution of intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation. The recent proliferation of genome‐scale analyses has revealed two further general observations: (a) complex speciation involving some form of gene flow is not uncommon, and (b) sex chromosomes in male‐ and in female‐heterogametic taxa tend to show elevated differentiation relative to autosomes. Together, these observations are consistent with speciation histories in which population genetic differentiation at autosomal loci is reduced by gene flow while natural selection against hybrid incompatibilities renders sex chromosomes relatively refractory to gene flow. Here, I summarize multilocus population genetic and population genomic evidence for greater differentiation on the X (or Z) vs. the autosomes and consider the possible causes. I review common population genetic circumstances involving no selection and/or no interspecific gene flow that are nevertheless expected to elevate differentiation on sex chromosomes relative to autosomes. I then review theory for why large X‐effects exist for hybrid incompatibilities and, more generally, for loci mediating local adaptation. The observed levels of sex chromosome vs. autosomal differentiation, in many cases, appear consistent with simple explanations requiring neither large X‐effects nor gene flow. Discerning signatures of large X‐effects during complex speciation will therefore require analyses that go beyond chromosome‐scale summaries of population genetic differentiation, explicitly test for differential introgression, and/or integrate experimental genetic data.},

Cane toads are known for their rapid adaptation and deleterious impacts on native fauna in invaded regions.

We used a combination of long-read Pacific Biosciences RS II and short-read Illumina HiSeq X sequencing to generate 359.5 Gb of raw sequence data.},

	abstract = {The two “rules of speciation,” Haldane’s rule (HR) and the large-X effect (LXE), are thought to be caused by recessive species incompatibilities exposed in the phenotype due to the hemizygosity of X-linked genes in the heterogametic sex. Thus, the reports of HR and the LXE in species with recently evolved non- or partially degenerate Y-chromosomes, such as Silene latifolia and its relatives, were surprising. Here, I argue that rapid species-specific degeneration of Y-linked genes and associated adjustment of expression of X-linked gametologs (dosage compensation) may lead to rapid evolution of sex-linked species incompatibilities. This process is likely to be too slow in species with old degenerate Y-chromosomes (e.g., in mammals), but Ydegeneration in species with young gene-rich sex chromosomes may be fast enough to play a significant role in speciation. To illustrate this point, I report the analysis of Y-degeneration and the associated evolution of gene expression on the X-chromosome of S. latifolia and Silene dioica, a close relative that shares the same recently evolved sex chromosomes. Despite the recent (≤1MY) divergence of the two species, {\textasciitilde}7\% of Y-linked genes have undergone degeneration in one but not the other species. This species-specific degeneration appears to drive faster expression divergence of X-linked genes, which may account for HR and the LXE reported for these species. Furthermore, I suggest that “exposure” of autosomal or sex-linked recessive species incompatibilities in the haploid plant gametophyte may mimic the presence of HR in plants. Both haploid expression and species-specific Y-degeneration need to receive more attention if we are to understand the role of these processes in speciation.},

Here, we review recent evidence extending HR to plants, where previously it has only been documented in animals.

	abstract = {Natural hybrid zones have proven to be precious tools for understanding the origin and maintenance of reproductive isolation (RI) and therefore species. Most available genomic studies of hybrid zones using whole- or partial-genome resequencing approaches have focused on comparisons of the parental source populations involved in genome admixture, rather than exploring ﬁne-scale patterns of chromosomal ancestry across the full admixture gradient present between hybridizing species. We have studied three well-known European ‘replicate’ hybrid zones of Populus alba and P. tremula, two widespread, ecologically divergent forest trees, using up to 432 505 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Estimates of ﬁne-scale chromosomal ancestry, genomic divergence and differentiation across all 19 poplar chromosomes revealed strikingly contrasting results, including an unexpected preponderance of F1 hybrids in the centre of genomic clines on the one hand, and genomically localized, spatially variable shared variants consistent with ancient introgression between the parental species on the other. Genetic ancestry had a signiﬁcant effect on survivorship of hybrid seedlings in a common garden trial, pointing to selection against early-generation recombinants. Our results indicate a role for selection against recombinant genotypes in maintaining RI in the face of apparent F1 fertility, consistent with the intragenomic ‘coadaptation’ model of barriers to introgression upon secondary contact. Whole-genome resequencing of hybridizing populations will clarify the roles of speciﬁc genetic pathways in RI between these model forest trees and may reveal which loci are affected most strongly by its cyclic breakdown.},

	abstract = {Most genetic studies of Haldane’s rule, in which hybrid sterility or inviability affects the heterogametic sex preferentially, have focused on Drosophila. It therefore remains unclear to what extent the conclusions of that work apply more generally, particularly in female-heterogametic taxa such as birds and Lepidoptera. Here we present a genetic analysis of Haldane’s rule in Heliconius butterﬂies. Female F1 hybrids between Heliconius melpomene and H. cydno are completely sterile, while males have normal to mildly reduced fertility. In backcrosses of male F1 hybrids, female offspring range from completely sterile to fully fertile. Linkage analysis using the Z-linked triose-phosphate isomerase locus demonstrates a “large X” (Z) effect on sterility. Expression of female sterility varies among crosses in this and a previous study of Heliconius. Sterility may result from the production of normal but infertile eggs, production of small infertile eggs, or from a complete failure to develop ovarioles, which suggests multiple routes to the evolution of hybrid sterility in these Heliconius species. These results conform to the expectations of the “dominance” rather than “faster male” theories of Haldane’s rule and suggest that relatively few loci are responsible. The two species are broadly sympatric and hybridize in the wild, so that female hybrid sterility forms one of several strong but incomplete barriers to gene ﬂow in nature. The effect of female sterility is comparable to that of selection against non-mimetic hybrids, while mate choice forms a much stronger barrier to gene transfer.},

Phylogenetic inference based on Sanger sequencing has not been sufficient to resolve species or deeper level relationships. Here, we apply restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to the lineage to infer phylogenetic relationships. We employ Quartet Sampling to assess information content and statistical support, and to quantify discordance as well as partitioned ABBA-BABA tests to uncover evidence of introgression. Our new results drastically improved resolution of relationships within Hawaiian Melicope. The lineage is divided into five fully supported main clades, two of which correspond to morphologically circumscribed infrageneric groups. We provide evidence for both ancestral and current hybridization events. We confirm the necessity for a taxonomic revision of the Melicope section Pelea, as well as a re-evaluation of several species complexes by combining genomic and morphological data.},

Here we describe a polynomial-time algorithm that computes the likelihood of a species tree directly from the markers under a finite-sites model of mutation effectively integrating over all possible gene trees. The method applies to independent (unlinked) biallelic markers such as well-spaced single nucleotide polymorphisms, and we have implemented it in SNAPP, a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler for inferring species trees, divergence dates, and population sizes. We report results from simulation experiments and from an analysis of 1997 amplified fragment length polymorphism loci in 69 individuals sampled from six species of Ourisia (New Zealand native foxglove).

This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birthdeath-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multiprocessor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.},

Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to ﬁnd optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to ﬁnd ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efﬁciently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2\% and 87.1\% of the studied alignments, thus efﬁciently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7\% and 47.1\% of the DNA alignments and 42.2\% and 100\% of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to 73.3–97.1\%. IQ-TREE is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/ iqtree.},

	abstract = {The extant amphibians are one of the most diverse radiations of terrestrial vertebrates ({\textgreater}6800 species). Despite much recent focus on their conservation, diversiﬁcation, and systematics, no previous phylogeny for the group has contained more than 522 species. However, numerous studies with limited taxon sampling have generated large amounts of partially overlapping sequence data for many species. Here, we combine these data and produce a novel estimate of extant amphibian phylogeny, containing 2871 species (\$40\% of the known extant species) from 432 genera (\$85\% of the \$500 currently recognized extant genera). Each sampled species contains up to 12,712 bp from 12 genes (three mitochondrial, nine nuclear), with an average of 2563 bp per species. This data set provides strong support for many groups recognized in previous studies, but it also suggests non-monophyly for several currently recognized families, particularly in hyloid frogs (e.g., Ceratophryidae, Cycloramphidae, Leptodactylidae, Strabomantidae). To correct these and other problems, we provide a revised classiﬁcation of extant amphibians for taxa traditionally delimited at the family and subfamily levels. This new taxonomy includes several families not recognized in current classiﬁcations (e.g., Alsodidae, Batrachylidae, Rhinodermatidae, Odontophrynidae, Telmatobiidae), but which are strongly supported and important for avoiding non-monophyly of current families. Finally, this study provides further evidence that the supermatrix approach provides an effective strategy for inferring large-scale phylogenies using the combined results of previous studies, despite many taxa having extensive missing data.},

Genomic sequence data can be used to infer introgression events and to estimate the timing and intensity of introgression, providing an important means to advance our understanding of the role of gene ﬂow in speciation. Here we implement the multispecies-coalescent-with-introgression (MSci) model, an extension of the multispeciescoalescent (MSC) model to incorporate introgression, in our Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) program BPP. The MSci model accommodates deep coalescence (or incomplete lineage sorting) and introgression and provides a natural framework for inference using genomic sequence data. Computer simulation conﬁrms the good statistical properties of the method, although hundreds or thousands of loci are typically needed to estimate introgression probabilities reliably. Re-analysis of datasets from the purple cone spruce conﬁrms the hypothesis of homoploid hybrid speciation. We estimated the introgression probability using the genomic sequence data from six mosquito species in the Anopheles gambiae species complex, which varies considerably across the genome, likely driven by differential selection against introgressed alleles.},

	abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs)—selfish DNA sequences that can move within the genome—comprise a large proportion of the genomes of many organisms. Although low-coverage whole genome sequencing can be used to survey TE composition, it is non-economical for species with large quantities of DNA. Here, we utilize restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq) as an alternative method to survey TE composition. First, we demonstrate in silico that double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) markers contain the same TE compositions as whole genome assemblies across arthropods. Next, we show empirically using eight Synalpheus snapping shrimp species with large genomes that TE compositions from ddRADseq and low-coverage whole genome sequencing are comparable within and across species. Finally, we develop a new bioinformatic pipeline, TERAD, to extract TE compositions from RADseq data. Our study expands the utility of RADseq to study the repeatome, making comparative studies of genome structure for species with large genomes more tractable and affordable.},

	abstract = {Fully Bayesian multispecies coalescent (MSC) methods like *BEAST estimate species trees from multiple sequence alignments. Today thousands of genes can be sequenced for a given study, but using that many genes with *BEAST is intractably slow. An alternative is to use heuristic methods which compromise accuracy or completeness in return for speed. A common heuristic is concatenation, which assumes that the evolutionary history of each gene tree is identical to the species tree. This is an inconsistent estimator of species tree topology, a worse estimator of divergence times, and induces spurious substitution rate variation when incomplete lineage sorting is present. Another class of heuristics directly motivated by the MSC avoids many of the pitfalls of concatenation but cannot be used to estimate divergence times. To enable fuller use of available data and more accurate inference of species tree topologies, divergence times, and substitution rates, we have developed a new version of *BEAST called StarBEAST2. To improve convergence rates we add analytical integration of population sizes, novel MCMC operators and other optimizations. Computational performance improved by 13.5Â and 13.8Â respectively when analyzing two empirical data sets, and an average of 33.1Â across 30 simulated data sets. To enable accurate estimates of per-species substitution rates, we introduce species tree relaxed clocks, and show that StarBEAST2 is a more powerful and robust estimator of rate variation than concatenation. StarBEAST2 is available through the BEAUTi package manager in BEAST 2.4 and above.},

Contrasting patterns of marker introgression in different sections of the contact can provide valuable insights on the relative importance of various evolutionary mechanisms maintaining species differences in the face of hybridization and gene flow and on hybrid zone temporal and spatial dynamics. We studied species interactions in the common toads Bufo bufo and B. spinosus in France and northwestern Italy using morphological and molecular data from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in an extensive survey, including two independent transects west and east of the Alps. At both, we found sharp, coincident and concordant nuclear genetic transitions. However, morphological clines were wider or absent and mtDNA introgression was asymmetric. We discuss alternative, nonexclusive hypotheses about evolutionary processes generating these patterns, including drift, selection, long-distance dispersal and spatial shifts in hybrid zone location and structure. The distribution of intraspecific mtDNA lineages supports a scenario in which B. bufo held a local refugium during the last glacial maximum. Present-day genetic profiles are best explained by an advance of B. spinosus from a nearby Iberian refugium, largely superseding the local B. bufo population, followed by an advance of B. bufo from the Balkans, with prongs north and south of the Alps, driving B. spinosus southwards. A pendulum moving hybrid zone, first northwards and then southwards, explains the wide areas of introgression at either side of the current position of the contact zones.},

The chorus comprised 50 B. microscaphus and 17 hybrids, identiﬁed on the basis of morphology and advertisement calls; no pure B. woodhousii were observed. Males produced advertisement calls throughout the early evening, even when relatively large numbers of males (Ͼ50) were present at the chorus; active searching and satellite tactics were not observed. Calling efforts (call duration ϫ call rate) of hybrids (23.9\%, n ϭ 8) and B. microscaphus (24.9\%, n ϭ 19) were similar and comparable to call efforts of B. woodhousii (21.9\%, n ϭ 10) from a different site. Moreover, repeatabilities of calling effort were signiﬁcant (r ϭ 0.45) for hybrid males, but not for B. microscaphus and B. woodhousii. Thus, calling behavior of hybrid males was neither signiﬁcantly reduced nor more variable than that of their parental species. The distribution of mtDNA haplotypes revealed directional introgression is occurring between male B. microscaphus and female B. woodhousii: All 17 hybrids possessed B. woodhousii mtDNA. The proximate mechanism driving hybridization appears to involve common male (B. microscaphus) and rare female (B. woodhousii) matings as B. woodhousii expands its range.},

This genetic footprint is represented by a trail of asymmetric tails and displaced cline centres in the wake of the moving hybrid zone. A peak of admixture linkage disequilibrium is predicted to exist ahead of the centre of the moving hybrid zone. We test these predictions of the movement hypothesis in a hybrid zone between common (Bufo bufo) and spined toads (B. spinosus), using 31 nuclear and one mtDNA SNPs along a transect in the northwest of France. Average effective selection in Bufo hybrids is low and clines vary in shape and centre. A weak pattern of asymmetric introgression is inferred from cline discordance of seven nuclear markers. The dominant direction of gene flow is from B. spinosus to B. bufo and is in support of southward movement of the hybrid zone. Conversely, a peak of admixture linkage disequilibrium north of the hybrid zone suggests northward movement. These contrasting results can be explained by reproductive isolation of the B. spinosus and B. bufo gene pools at the southern (B. spinosus) side of the hybrid zone. The joint occurrence of asymmetric introgression and admixture linkage disequilibrium can also be explained by the combination of low dispersal and random genetic drift due to low effective population sizes.},

Comparison with in silico predictions revealed that 1) over 90\% of predicted, single-copy loci in our targeted size range (178–328 bp) were recovered; 2) short restriction fragments (38–178 bp) were carried through the size selection step and sequenced at appreciable depth, generating unexpected but nonetheless useful data; 3) amplification bias favored shorter, GC-rich fragments, contributing to among locus variation in sequencing depth that was strongly correlated across samples; 4) our use of restriction enzymes with a GC-rich recognition sequence resulted in an up to four-fold overrepresentation of GC-rich portions of the genome; and 5) star activity (i.e., non-specific cutting) resulted in thousands of ‘‘extra’’ loci sequenced at low depth. Results for three species of indigobirds show that a common set of thousands of loci can be consistently recovered across both individual samples and sequencing runs. In a run with 46 samples, we genotyped 5,996 loci in all individuals and 9,833 loci in 42 or more individuals, resulting in ,1\% missing data for the larger data set. We compare our approach to similar methods and discuss the range of factors (fragment library preparation, natural genetic variation, bioinformatics) influencing the recovery of a consistent set of loci among samples.},

	abstract = {Background: RAD-seq is a powerful tool, increasingly used in population genomics. However, earlier studies have raised red flags regarding possible biases associated with this technique. In particular, polymorphism on restriction sites results in preferential sampling of closely related haplotypes, so that RAD data tends to underestimate genetic diversity.
Results: Here we (1) clarify the theoretical basis of this bias, highlighting the potential confounding effects of population structure and selection, (2) confront predictions to real data from in silico digestion of full genomes and (3) provide a proof of concept toward an ABC-based correction of the RAD-seq bias. Under a neutral and panmictic model, we confirm the previously established relationship between the true polymorphism and its RAD-based estimation, showing a more pronounced bias when polymorphism is high. Using more elaborate models, we show that selection, resulting in heterogeneous levels of polymorphism along the genome, exacerbates the bias and leads to a more pronounced underestimation. On the contrary, spatial genetic structure tends to reduce the bias. We confront the neutral and panmictic model to “ideal” empirical data (in silico RAD-sequencing) using full genomes from natural populations of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the fungus Shizophyllum commune, harbouring respectively moderate and high genetic diversity. In D. melanogaster, predictions fit the model, but the small difference between the true and RAD polymorphism makes this comparison insensitive to deviations from the model. In the highly polymorphic fungus, the model captures a large part of the bias but makes inaccurate predictions. Accordingly, ABC corrections based on this model improve the estimations, albeit with some imprecisions.
Conclusion: The RAD-seq underestimation of genetic diversity associated with polymorphism in restriction sites becomes more pronounced when polymorphism is high. In practice, this means that in many systems where polymorphism does not exceed 2 \%, the bias is of minor importance in the face of other sources of uncertainty, such as heterogeneous bases composition or technical artefacts. The neutral panmictic model provides a practical mean to correct the bias through ABC, albeit with some imprecisions. More elaborate ABC methods might integrate additional parameters, such as population structure and selection, but their opposite effects could hinder accurate corrections.},

	abstract = {Inexpensive short-read sequencing technologies applied to reduced representation genomes is revolutionizing genetic research, especially population genetics analysis, by allowing the genotyping of massive numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for large numbers of individuals and populations. Restriction site–associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a recent technique based on the characterization of genomic regions ﬂanking restriction sites. One of its potential drawbacks is the presence of polymorphism within the restriction site, which makes it impossible to observe the associated SNP allele (i.e. allele dropout, ADO). To investigate the effect of ADO on genetic variation estimated from RAD markers, we ﬁrst mathematically derived measures of the effect of ADO on allele frequencies as a function of different parameters within a single population. We then used RAD data sets simulated using a coalescence model to investigate the magnitude of biases induced by ADO on the estimation of expected heterozygosity and FST under a simple demographic model of divergence between two populations. We found that ADO tends to overestimate genetic variation both within and between populations. Assuming a mutation rate per nucleotide between 10−9 and 10−8, this bias remained low for most studied combinations of divergence time and effective population size, except for large effective population sizes. Averaging FST values over multiple SNPs, for example, by sliding window analysis, did not correct ADO biases. We brieﬂy discuss possible solutions to ﬁlter the most problematic cases of ADO using read coverage to detect markers with a large excess of null alleles.},

	abstract = {The multispecies coalescent (MSC) model has emerged as a powerful framework for inferring species phylogenies while accounting for ancestral polymorphism and gene tree-species tree conﬂict. A number of methods have been developed in the past few years to estimate the species tree under the MSC. The full likelihood methods (including maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) average over the unknown gene trees and accommodate their uncertainties properly but involve intensive computation. The approximate or summary coalescent methods are computationally fast and are applicable to genomic datasets with thousands of loci, but do not make an efﬁcient use of information in the multilocus data. Most of them take the two-step approach of reconstructing the gene trees for multiple loci by phylogenetic methods and then treating the estimated gene trees as observed data, without accounting for their uncertainties appropriately. In this article we review the statistical nature of the species tree estimation problem under the MSC, and explore the conceptual issues and challenges of species tree estimation by focusing mainly on simple cases of three or four closely related species. We use mathematical analysis and computer simulation to demonstrate that large differences in statistical performance may exist between the two classes of methods. We illustrate that several counterintuitive behaviors may occur with the summary methods but they are due to inefﬁcient use of information in the data by summary methods and vanish when the data are analyzed using full-likelihood methods. These include (i) unidentiﬁability of parameters in the model, (ii) inconsistency in the so-called anomaly zone, (iii) singularity on the likelihood surface, and (iv) deterioration of performance upon addition of more data. We discuss the challenges and strategies of species tree inference for distantly related species when the molecular clock is violated, and highlight the need for improving the computational efﬁciency and model realism of the likelihood methods as well as the statistical efﬁciency of the summary methods.},

	abstract = {The focus of this article is a Bayesian method for inferring both species delimitations and species trees under the multispecies coalescent model using molecular sequences from multiple loci. The species delimitation requires no a priori assignment of individuals to species, and no guide tree. The method is implemented in a package called STACEY for BEAST2, and is a extension of the author’s DISSECT package. Here we demonstrate considerable efﬁciency improvements by using three new operators for sampling from the posterior using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and by using a model for the population size parameters along the branches of the species tree which allows these parameters to be integrated out. The correctness of the moves is demonstrated by tests of the implementation. The practice of using a pipeline approach to species delimitation under the multispecies coalescent, has been shown to have major problems on simulated data (Olave et al. in Syst Biol 63:263–271. doi:10.1093/sysbio/syt106, 2014). The same simulated data set is used to demonstrate the accuracy and improved convergence of the present method. We also compare performance with *BEAST for a ﬁxed delimitation analysis on a large data set, and again show improved convergence.},

Boundaries between species in sympatry are maintained by intrinsic barriers to gene exchange; these boundaries may not be uniform in space, in time, or across the genome. Here, we explore the nature of the species boundary, defined as the phenotypes/genes/genome regions that remain differentiated in the face of potential hybridization and introgression. We emphasize that species boundaries are semipermeable, with permeability (gene exchange) being a function of genome region. The early evidence for semipermeable species boundaries came from data on differential introgression in hybrid zones. This “genic view” of species was common in the hybrid zone literature even when few molecular markers were available to characterize genome-wide patterns of variation. Now, molecular tools allow detailed characterization of differentiation between diverging lineages and patterns of variation across natural hybrid zones, but the questions being asked by evolutionary biologists have remained much the same. Recent data (from DNA sequences and genotypes) reinforce earlier conclusions about the semipermeable nature of most species boundaries. However, debate persists over the nature and extent of genome divergence that accompanies speciation.},

Understanding phylogenetic relationships between organisms is a prerequisite of almost any evolutionary study, as contemporary species all share a common history through their ancestry. Moreover, it is important because of its wide applications that include understanding genome organization, epidemiological investigations, predicting protein functions, and deciding the genes to be analyzed in comparative studies. Despite immense progress in recent years, phylogenetic reconstruction involves many challenges that create uncertainty with respect to the true evolutionary relationships of the species or genes analyzed. One of the most notable difficulties is the widespread occurrence of incongruence among methods and also among individual genes or different genomic regions. Presence of widespread incongruence inhibits successful revealing of evolutionary relationships and applications of phylogenetic analysis. In this article, I concisely review the effect of various factors that cause incongruence in molecular phylogenies, the advances in the field that resolved some factors, and explore unresolved factors that cause incongruence along with possible ways for tackling them.},

First, the (gene) tree describing the evolution of each gene may differ from the species tree, for instance, due to incomplete lineage sorting. Second, the aligned genetic sequences at the leaves of each gene tree provide merely an imperfect estimate of the topology of the gene tree. In this note, we demonstrate formally that a basic statistical problem arises if one tries to avoid accounting for these two processes and analyses the genetic data directly via a concatenation approach. More precisely, we show that, under the multispecies coalescent with a standard site substitution model, maximum likelihood estimation on sequence data that has been concatenated across genes and performed under the incorrect assumption that all sites have evolved independently and identically on a fixed tree is a statistically inconsistent estimator of the species tree. Our results provide a formal justification of simulation results described of Kubatko and Degnan (2007) and others, and complements recent theoretical results by DeGIorgio and Degnan (2010) and Chifman and Kubtako (2014).},

A barrier to gene ﬂow distorts this classical pattern of isolation by distance. Genetic similarity is decreased for sample pairs on different sides of the barrier and increased for pairs on the same side near the barrier. Here, we introduce an inference scheme that uses this signal to detect and estimate the strength of a linear barrier to gene ﬂow in two dimensions. We use a diffusion approximation to model the effects of a barrier on the geographic spread of ancestry backward in time. This approach allows us to calculate the chance of recent coalescence and probability of identity by descent. We introduce an inference scheme that ﬁts these theoretical results to the geographic covariance structure of bialleleic genetic markers. It can estimate the strength of the barrier as well as several demographic parameters. We investigate the power of our inference scheme to detect barriers by applying it to a wide range of simulated data. We also showcase an example application to an Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon) ﬂower-color hybrid zone, where we do not detect any signal of a strong genome-wide barrier to gene ﬂow.},

	abstract = {Research aimed at understanding the geographic context of evolutionary histories is burgeoning across biological disciplines. Recent endeavors attempt to interpret contemporaneous genetic variation in the light of increasingly detailed geographical and environmental observations. Such interest has promoted the development of phylogeographic inference techniques that explicitly aim to integrate such heterogeneous data. One promising development involves reconstructing phylogeographic history on a continuous landscape. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical approach to infer continuous phylogeographic diffusion using random walk models while simultaneously reconstructing the evolutionary history in time from molecular sequence data. Moreover, by accommodating branch-speciﬁc variation in dispersal rates, we relax the most restrictive assumption of the standard Brownian diffusion process and demonstrate increased statistical efﬁciency in spatial reconstructions of overdispersed random walks by analyzing both simulated and real viral genetic data. We further illustrate how drawing inference about summary statistics from a fully speciﬁed stochastic process over both sequence evolution and spatial movement reveals important characteristics of a rabies epidemic. Together with recent advances in discrete phylogeographic inference, the continuous model developments furnish a ﬂexible statistical framework for biogeographical reconstructions that is easily expanded upon to accommodate various landscape genetic features.},

	abstract = {Numerous methods for inferring species-level phylogenies under the coalescent model have been proposed within the last 20 years, and debates continue about the relative strengths and weaknesses of these methods. The approaches taken by these methods can be classified into three groups. Summary methods carry out inference for multilocus data by first computing a summary statistic for each locus, and then forming an estimate of the species phylogeny using these single-locus summaries as input. Such methods are often criticized for failing to account for uncertainty in the estimates computed for each locus in the second stage of the analysis. The second class of methods have been referred to as "full data methods" because they utilize the sequence data directly by carrying out estimation in a Bayesian framework, with specific implementations designed to handle either multilocus or SNP data. Because such methods require both computation of the likelihood and Markov chain Monte Carlo for inference, they are limited in the size of the data sets that can be analyzed. The third class of methods uses the information available in the observed site pattern frequencies to estimate the species phylogeny by inferring the phylogenetic relationships among quartets of taxa and then using quartet assembly methods to construct the overall species tree estimate. Although designed for coalescent independent sites data, methods based on site pattern frequencies can be easily modified to accommodate both SNP and multilocus data. Recently, Shi and Yang (2018) hypothesized that site pattern-based methods are less efficient than likelihood-based methods. Here, we show that the site pattern-based method SVDQuartets is statistically consistent and has the same order of convergence as maximum likelihood, which we verify is also statistically consistent. We provide theoretical justification for the use of SVDQuartets with multilocus data, and discuss the impact of the number of sites and number of loci considered in multilocus studies. Finally, we compare the performance of maximum likelihood and SDVQuartets using simulation, and show that although both have the same order of convergence, under certain conditions either may show better performance.},

We review existing methods and empirical studies to identify recent advances in the genomics of hybridization, as well as issues that need to be addressed. Notable progress has been made in the development of methods for detecting hybridization and inferring individual ancestries. However, few approaches reconstruct the magnitude and timing of gene ﬂow, estimate the ﬁtness of hybrids or incorporate knowledge of recombination rate. Empirical studies indicate that the genomic consequences of hybridization are complex, including a highly heterogeneous landscape of differentiation. Inferred characteristics of hybridization differ substantially among species groups. Loci showing unusual patterns – which may contribute to reproductive barriers – are usually scattered throughout the genome, with potential enrichment in sex chromosomes and regions of reduced recombination. We caution against the growing trend of interpreting genomic variation in summary statistics across genomes as evidence of differential gene ﬂow. We argue that converting genomic patterns into useful inferences about hybridization will ultimately require models and methods that directly incorporate key ingredients of speciation, including the dynamic nature of gene ﬂow, selection acting in hybrid populations and recombination rate variation.},

	abstract = {Background: Phylogenies, i.e., the evolutionary histories of groups of taxa, play a major role in representing the interrelationships among biological entities. Many software tools for reconstructing and evaluating such phylogenies have been proposed, almost all of which assume the underlying evolutionary history to be a tree. While trees give a satisfactory first-order approximation for many families of organisms, other families exhibit evolutionary mechanisms that cannot be represented by trees. Processes such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), hybrid speciation, and interspecific recombination, collectively referred to as reticulate evolutionary events, result in networks, rather than trees, of relationships. Various software tools have been recently developed to analyze reticulate evolutionary relationships, which include SplitsTree4, LatTrans, EEEP, HorizStory, and T-REX.
Results: In this paper, we report on the PhyloNet software package, which is a suite of tools for analyzing reticulate evolutionary relationships, or evolutionary networks, which are rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, leaf-labeled by a set of taxa. These tools can be classified into four categories: (1) evolutionary network representation: reading/writing evolutionary networks in a newly devised compact form; (2) evolutionary network characterization: analyzing evolutionary networks in terms of three basic building blocks – trees, clusters, and tripartitions; (3) evolutionary network comparison: comparing two evolutionary networks in terms of topological dissimilarities, as well as fitness to sequence evolution under a maximum parsimony criterion; and (4) evolutionary network reconstruction: reconstructing an evolutionary network from a species tree and a set of gene trees.
Conclusion: The software package, PhyloNet, offers an array of utilities to allow for efficient and accurate analysis of evolutionary networks. The software package will help significantly in analyzing large data sets, as well as in studying the performance of evolutionary network reconstruction methods. Further, the software package supports the proposed eNewick format for compact representation of evolutionary networks, a feature that allows for efficient interoperability of evolutionary network software tools. Currently, all utilities in PhyloNet are invoked on the command line.},

Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci—e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

	abstract = {Standard models of molecular evolution cannot estimate absolute speciation times alone, and require external calibrations to do so, such as fossils. Because fossil calibration methods rely on the incomplete fossil record, a great number of nodes in the tree of life cannot be dated precisely. However, many major paleogeographical events are dated, and since biogeographic processes depend on paleogeographical conditions, biogeographic dating may be used as an alternative or complementary method to fossil dating. I demonstrate how a time-stratiﬁed biogeographic stochastic process may be used to estimate absolute divergence times by conditioning on dated paleogeographical events. Informed by the current paleogeographical literature, I construct an empirical dispersal graph using 25 areas and 26 epochs for the past 540 Ma of Earth’s history. Simulations indicate biogeographic dating performs well so long as paleogeography imposes constraint on biogeographic character evolution. To gauge whether biogeographic dating may be of practical use, I analyzed the wellstudied turtle clade (Testudines) to assess how well biogeographic dating fares when compared to fossil-calibrated dating estimates reported in the literature. Fossil-free biogeographic dating estimated the age of the most recent common ancestor of extant turtles to be from the Late Triassic, which is consistent with fossil-based estimates. Dating precision improves further when including a root node fossil calibration. The described model, paleogeographical dispersal graph, and analysis scripts are available for use with RevBayes.

The method is tested across a range of conditions and is shown to be accurate even with single-locus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data. We apply this method to a landmark dataset of putative simultaneous vicariance, eight geminate echinoid taxon pairs thought to have been split by the Isthmus of Panama 3.1 million years ago. The ABC posterior estimates are not consistent with a history of simultaneous vicariance given these data. Subsequent ABC estimates under a constrained model that assumes two divergence times across the eight taxon pairs suggests simultaneous divergence 3.1 million years ago in seven of the taxon pairs and a more recent divergence in the remaining taxon pair. These ABC estimates on the simultaneous divergence of the seven taxon pairs correspond to a DNA substitution rate of approximately 1.59\% per lineage per million years at the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I gene. This ABC framework can easily be modiﬁed to analyze single taxon-pair datasets and/or be expanded to include multiple loci, migration, recombination, and other idiosyncratic demographic histories. The ﬂexible aspect of ABC and its built-in evaluation of estimator bias and statistical power has the potential to greatly enhance statistical rigor in phylogeographic studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Although testing for simultaneous divergence (vicariance) across different population-pairs that span the same barrier to gene flow is of central importance to evolutionary biology, researchers often equate the gene tree and population/species tree thereby ignoring stochastic coalescent variance in their conclusions of temporal incongruence. In contrast to other available phylogeographic software packages, msBayes is the only one that analyses data from multiple species/population pairs under a hierarchical model.
Results: msBayes employs approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) under a hierarchical coalescent model to test for simultaneous divergence (TSD) in multiple co-distributed populationpairs. Simultaneous isolation is tested by estimating three hyper-parameters that characterize the degree of variability in divergence times across co-distributed population pairs while allowing for variation in various within population-pair demographic parameters (sub-parameters) that can affect the coalescent. msBayes is a software package consisting of several C and R programs that are run with a Perl "front-end".
Conclusion: The method reasonably distinguishes simultaneous isolation from temporal incongruence in the divergence of co-distributed population pairs, even with sparse sampling of individuals. Because the estimate step is decoupled from the simulation step, one can rapidly evaluate different ABC acceptance/rejection conditions and the choice of summary statistics. Given the complex and idiosyncratic nature of testing multi-species biogeographic hypotheses, we envision msBayes as a powerful and flexible tool for tackling a wide array of difficult research questions that use population genetic data from multiple co-distributed species. The msBayes pipeline is available for download at http://msbayes.sourceforge.net/ under an open source license (GNU Public License). The msBayes pipeline is comprised of several C and R programs that are run with a Perl "front-end" and runs on Linux, Mac OS-X, and most POSIX systems.

	abstract = {Background: To understand biological diversification, it is important to account for large-scale processes that affect the evolutionary history of groups of co-distributed populations of organisms. Such events predict temporally clustered divergences times, a pattern that can be estimated using genetic data from co-distributed species. I introduce a new approximate-Bayesian method for comparative phylogeographical model-choice that estimates the temporal distribution of divergences across taxa from multi-locus DNA sequence data. The model is an extension of that implemented in msBayes.
Results: By reparameterizing the model, introducing more flexible priors on demographic and divergence-time parameters, and implementing a non-parametric Dirichlet-process prior over divergence models, I improved the robustness, accuracy, and power of the method for estimating shared evolutionary history across taxa.
Conclusions: The results demonstrate the improved performance of the new method is due to (1) more appropriate priors on divergence-time and demographic parameters that avoid prohibitively small marginal likelihoods for models with more divergence events, and (2) the Dirichlet-process providing a flexible prior on divergence histories that does not strongly disfavor models with intermediate numbers of divergence events. The new method yields more robust estimates of posterior uncertainty, and thus greatly reduces the tendency to incorrectly estimate models of shared evolutionary history with strong support.},

Detecting how species within communities have demographically tracked each other in space and time is important for understanding the effects of future climate and landscape changes and the resulting acceleration of extinctions, biological invasions, and potential surges in adaptive evolution. Here, we present a statistical framework for such an analysis based on hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (hABC) with the goal of detecting concerted demographic histories across an ecological assemblage. Our method combines population genetic data sets from multiple taxa into a single analysis to estimate: 1) the proportion of a community sample that demographically expanded in a temporally clustered pulse and 2) when the pulse occurred. To validate the accuracy and utility of this new approach, we use simulation cross-validation experiments and subsequently analyze an empirical data set of 32 avian populations from Australia that are hypothesized to have expanded from smaller refugia populations in the late Pleistocene. The method can accommodate data set heterogeneity such as variability in effective population size, mutation rates, and sample sizes across species and exploits the statistical strength from the simultaneous analysis of multiple species. This hABC framework used in a multitaxa demographic context can increase our understanding of the impact of historical climate change by determining what proportion of the community responded in concert or independently and can be used with a wide variety of comparative phylogeographic data sets as biota-wide DNA barcoding data sets accumulate.},

New sequencing technology now provides the potential to perform complex demographic inference at unprecedented resolution across assemblages of non-model species. To this end, we introduce the aggregate site frequency spectrum (aSFS), an expansion of the site frequency spectrum to use single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets collected from multiple, co-distributed species for assemblage-level demographic inference. We describe how the aSFS is constructed over an arbitrary number of independent population samples and then demonstrate how the aSFS can differentiate various multi-species demographic histories under a wide range of sampling configurations while allowing effective population sizes and expansion magnitudes to vary independently. We subsequently couple the aSFS with a hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (hABC) framework to estimate degree of temporal synchronicity in expansion times across taxa, including an empirical demonstration with a dataset consisting of five populations of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Corroborating what is generally understood about the recent post-glacial origins of these populations, the joint aSFS/hABC analysis strongly suggests that the stickleback data are most consistent with synchronous expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum (posterior probability = 0.99). The aSFS will have general application for multi-level statistical frameworks to test models involving assemblages and/or communities and as large-scale SNP data from nonmodel species become routine, the aSFS expands the potential for powerful next-generation comparative population genomic inference.},

Expansion occurred in 75\% of 74 lineages, and of these, population size trajectories across the community were partially synchronous, with coexpansion found in at least 50\% of lineages in each taxonomic group. For those taxa expanding outside of these synchronous pulses, factors related to when they entered the community, ecological thresholds or biotic interactions likely condition their timing of response to Pleistocene climate change.

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing of restriction site associated DNA, or RADseq, was introduced in 2008 as a rapid genotyping method that does not require prior marker development. Developed for linkage mapping, genome-wide association, and population genetic studies, RADseq was initially viewed as ill-suited to interspecific phylogenetic questions. However, since 2012, approximately a dozen RADseq phylogenetic studies have been published. These studies utilize a variety of bioinformatic methods to identify loci, estimate orthology, and assemble phylogenetic matrices, and software pipelines customized for phylogenetic analyses are being rapidly developed. The resulting data matrices tend to be large (sometimes megabases in total aligned length) but relatively incomplete, presenting analytical challenges. Empirical and simulated RADseq studies have demonstrated that RADseq is suitable for phylogenetic inquiries at relatively deep scales, in some cases at least 60 million years. Yet its real strengths may show up at the boundary between within- and among-species inquiries. As sequence-based data, RADseq can be mapped to genomic resources for purposes of alignment, gene identification, and investigating the genomic architecture of introgression and differentiation. Given the ease with which RADseq data can be generated, particularly in comparison to targeted enrichment methods that require prior identification of candidate loci, in the coming years we anticipate greater use of RADseq for phylogenetic inference and predict that methods of species-tree estimation and genomic analysis will increasingly accommodate its characteristically large, incomplete, genome-scale data matrices.},

Decisions about which loci to target in empirical studies are typically constrained by availability, technology and funds – characteristics that are not typically considered in simulation studies. As a result, most real-world datasets often combine one or two variable loci (such as mtDNA or chloroplast loci) with multiple lower-variation loci to estimate species trees. These locus selections impact the accuracy and the resolution of a phylogeny. Furthermore, the fact that using a larger sample of loci can result in lower posterior probabilities has been used as an excuse to drop loci from an analysis. Here we address these issues directly through a simulation approach designed to mimic situations arising in empirical datasets by combining loci with differing mutation rates. We show that low-variation loci can be utilized in species-tree analyses that account for gene-tree uncertainty (e.g., a Bayesian framework), whereas maximum likelihood approaches show no improvement in accuracy when low-variation loci are added. We demonstrate that limited phylogenetic signal associated with low-variation loci constrains gains in species-tree estimation accuracy when adding loci. Lastly, we demonstrate that the inclusion of only a handful of loci with higher mutation rates, and hence greater phylogenetic information content, can make a tremendous difference in the accuracy of species-tree estimates, suggesting that empiricists should consider the quality, and not just quantity, of loci in multi-locus phylogenetic analyses.},

	abstract = {The development and application of coalescent methods are undergoing rapid changes. One little explored area that bears on the application of gene-tree-based coalescent methods to species tree estimation is gene informativeness. Here, we investigate the accuracy of these coalescent methods when genes have minimal phylogenetic information, including the implementation of the multilocus bootstrap approach. Using simulated DNA sequences, we demonstrate that genes with minimal phylogenetic information can produce unreliable gene trees (i.e., high error in gene tree estimation), which may in turn reduce the accuracy of species tree estimation using gene-tree-based coalescent methods. We demonstrate that this problem can be alleviated by sampling more genes, as is commonly done in large-scale phylogenomic analyses. This applies even when these genes are minimally informative. If gene tree estimation is biased, however, gene-tree-based coalescent analyses will produce inconsistent results, which cannot be remedied by increasing the number of genes. In this case, it is not the gene-tree-based coalescent methods that are ﬂawed, but rather the input data (i.e., estimated gene trees). Along these lines, the commonly used program PhyML has a tendency to infer one particular bifurcating topology even though it is best represented as a polytomy. We additionally corroborate these ﬁndings by analyzing the 183-locus mammal data set assembled by McCormack et al. (2012) using ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) and ﬂanking DNA. Lastly, we demonstrate that when employing the multilocus bootstrap approach on this 183-locus data set, there is no strong conﬂict between species trees estimated from concatenation and gene-tree-based coalescent analyses, as has been previously suggested by Gatesy and Springer (2014).},

	abstract = {Bayesian methods can be used to accurately estimate species tree topologies, times and other parameters, but only when the models of evolution which are available and utilized suﬃciently account for the underlying evolutionary processes. Multispecies coalescent (MSC) models have been shown to accurately account for the evolution of genes within species in the absence of strong gene ﬂow between lineages, and fossilized birth-death (FBD) models have been shown to estimate divergence times from fossil data in good agreement with expert opinion. Until now dating analyses using the MSC have been based on a ﬁxed clock or informally derived node priors instead of the FBD. On the other hand, dating analyses using an FBD process have concatenated all gene sequences and ignored coalescence processes. To address these mirror-image deﬁciencies in evolutionary models, we have developed an integrative model of evolution which combines both the FBD and MSC models. By applying concatenation and the MSC (without employing the FBD process) to an exemplar data set consisting of molecular sequence data and morphological characters from the dog and fox subfamily Caninae, we show that concatenation causes predictable biases in estimated branch lengths. We then applied concatenation using the FBD process and the combined FBD-MSC model to show that the same biases are still observed when the FBD process is employed. These biases can be avoided by using the FBD-MSC model, which coherently models fossilization and gene evolution, and does not require an a priori substitution rate estimate to calibrate the molecular clock. We have implemented the FBD-MSC in a new version of StarBEAST2, a package developed for the BEAST2 phylogenetic software.},

	abstract = {The effective population sizes of ancestral as well as modern species are important parameters in models of population genetics and human evolution. The commonly used method for estimating ancestral population sizes, based on counting mismatches between the species tree and the inferred gene trees, is highly biased as it ignores uncertainties in gene tree reconstruction. In this article, we develop a Bayes method for simultaneous estimation of the species divergence times and current and ancestral population sizes. The method uses DNA sequence data from multiple loci and extracts information about conﬂicts among gene tree topologies and coalescent times to estimate ancestral population sizes. The topology of the species tree is assumed known. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is implemented to integrate over uncertain gene trees and branch lengths (or coalescence times) at each locus as well as species divergence times. The method can handle any species tree and allows different numbers of sequences at different loci. We apply the method to published noncoding DNA sequences from the human and the great apes. There are strong correlations between posterior estimates of speciation times and ancestral population sizes. With the use of an informative prior for the human-chimpanzee divergence date, the population size of the common ancestor of the two species is estimated to be ف20,000, with a 95\% credibility interval (8000, 40,000). Our estimates, however, are affected by model assumptions as well as data quality. We suggest that reliable estimates have yet to await more data and more realistic models.},

The recent proliferation of DNA sequencing technologies has sparked a rapid increase in the volume of genetic data being applied to phylogenetic studies. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, ubiquitous genetic markers once considered reserved for population genetic studies, are now being applied in phylogenetics research at deep evolutionary timescales. The potential for SNPs to resolve contentious phylogenetic problems while researchers also investigate population demographics is promising, yet serious challenges remain with respect to data collection, assembly, modeling, and analysis. The low cost and ease of collecting SNPs suggest that they will remain an important source of genetic information for inferring phylogenies across time periods ranging from the Anthropocene to the Cretaceous.},

	abstract = {Background: The multispecies coalescent model has become popular in recent years as a framework to infer a species phylogeny from multilocus genetic data collected from multiple individuals. The model assumes that speciation occurs at a speciﬁc point in time, after which the two sub-species evolve in total isolation. However in reality speciation may occur over an extended period of time, during which sister lineages remain in partial contact. Inference of multispecies phylogenies under those conditions is diﬃcult. Indeed even designing simulators which correctly sample gene histories under these conditions is non-trivial.
Results: In this paper we present a method and software which simulates gene trees under both the multispecies coalescent and migration. Our approach allows for both population sizes and migration rates to change over the species lifetime. Also, migration rates are speciﬁed in units of fraction of emigrants per time unit, which makes them easier to interpret. Overall this setup covers a wide range of migration scenarios. The software can be used to investigate properties of gene trees under diﬀerent migration settings and to generate test cases for programs which infer species trees and/or migration from sequence data. Using simulated data we investigate the eﬀect of migrations between sister lineages on the inference of multispecies phylogenies and on post analysis detection.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that while estimation of species tree topology can be quite robust to the presence of gene ﬂow, the inference and detection of migration is problematic, even with methods based on full likelihood models.},

We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in F2 individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in Neurospora crassa. Sequencing of RAD markers is an integrated platform for SNP discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms.},

	abstract = {Adaptive genetic variation has been thought to originate primarily from either new mutation or standing variation. Another potential source of adaptive variation is adaptive variants from other (donor) species that are introgressed into the (recipient) species, termed adaptive introgression. Here, the various attributes of these three potential sources of adaptive variation are compared. For example, the rate of adaptive change is generally thought to be faster from standing variation, slower from mutation and potentially intermediate from adaptive introgression. Additionally, the higher initial frequency of adaptive variation from standing variation and lower initial frequency from mutation might result in a higher probability of ﬁxation of the adaptive variants for standing variation. Adaptive variation from introgression might have higher initial frequency than new adaptive mutations but lower than that from standing variation, again making the impact of adaptive introgression variation potentially intermediate. Adaptive introgressive variants might have multiple changes within a gene and affect multiple loci, an advantage also potentially found for adaptive standing variation but not for new adaptive mutants. The processes that might produce a common variant in two taxa, convergence, trans-species polymorphism from incomplete lineage sorting or from balancing selection and adaptive introgression, are also compared. Finally, potential examples of adaptive introgression in animals, including balancing selection for multiple alleles for major histocompatibility complex (MHC), S and csd genes, pesticide resistance in mice, black colour in wolves and white colour in coyotes, Neanderthal or Denisovan ancestry in humans, mimicry genes in Heliconius butterﬂies, beak traits in Darwin’s ﬁnches, yellow skin in chickens and non-native ancestry in an endangered native salamander, are examined.},

Both two-island models, which have symmetric gene ﬂow, and continent-island models, which have one-way gene ﬂow, are explored. Reinforcement is found to occur much more easily in a two-island assortative mating model than in any of the other three models. This is due primarily to the fact that in this model the assortative mating allele will automatically become genetically associated in each population with the trait allele that is favored by natural selection on that island. In contrast, natural selection on the trait both favors and opposes the evolution of premating isolation in the two-island preference model, depending on the particular population. These results imply that species recognition in the context of mating may evolve particularly easily when it targets cues that are favored by natural selection in each population. In the continent-island models, reinforcement is found to occur more often under the preference model than the assortative mating model, thus reversing the trend from the two-island models. Patterns of population subdivision may therefore play a role in determining what types of premating isolation may evolve.},

The rates of mitochondrial and nuclear introgression often differ, with some taxa showing biases for mitochondrial introgression and others for nuclear introgression. Several hypotheses exist to explain such biases, including adaptive introgression, sex differences in dispersal rates, sexspeciﬁc prezygotic isolation and sex-speciﬁc ﬁtness of hybrids (e.g. Haldane’s rule). We derive a simple population genetic model that permits an analysis of sex-speciﬁc demographic and ﬁtness parameters and measures the relative rates of mitochondrial and nuclear introgression between hybridizing pairs. We do this separately for diploid and haplodiploid species. For diploid taxa, we recover results consistent with previous hypotheses: an excess of one sex among the hybridizing migrants or sex-speciﬁc prezygotic isolation causes a bias for one type of marker or the other; when Haldane’s rule is obeyed, we ﬁnd a mitochondrial bias in XY systems and a nuclear bias in ZW systems. For haplodiploid taxa, the model reveals that owing to their unique transmission genetics, they are seemingly assured of strong mitochondrial biases in introgression rates, unlike diploid taxa, where the relative ﬁtness of male and female hybrids can tip the bias in either direction. This heretofore overlooked aspect of hybridization in haplodiploids provides what is perhaps the most likely explanation for differential introgression of mitochondrial and nuclear markers and raises concerns about the use of mitochondrial DNA barcodes for species delimitation in these taxa.},

	abstract = {Studies of a hybrid zone between two house mouse subspecies (Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus) along with studies using laboratory crosses reveal a large role for the X chromosome and multiple autosomal regions in reproductive isolation as a consequence of disrupted epistasis in hybrids. One limitation of previous work has been that most of the identified genomic regions have been large. The goal here is to detect and characterize precise genomic regions underlying reproductive isolation. We surveyed 1401 markers evenly spaced across the genome in 679 mice collected from two different transects. Comparisons between transects provide a means for identifying common patterns that likely reflect intrinsic incompatibilities. We used a genomic cline approach to identify patterns that correspond to epistasis. From both transects, we identified contiguous regions on the X chromosome in which markers were inferred to be involved in epistatic interactions. We then searched for autosomal regions showing the same patterns and found they constitute about 5\% of autosomal markers. We discovered substantial overlap between these candidate regions underlying reproductive isolation and QTL for hybrid sterility identified in laboratory crosses. Analysis of gene content in these regions suggests a key role for several mechanisms, including the regulation of transcription, sexual conflict and sexual selection operating at both the postmating prezygotic and postzygotic stages of reproductive isolation. Taken together, these results indicate that speciation in two recently diverged (c. 0.5 Ma) house mouse subspecies is complex, involving many genes dispersed throughout the genome and associated with distinct functions.},

	abstract = {Sex chromosomes have evolved many times in animals and studying these replicate evolutionary “experiments” can help broaden our understanding of the general forces driving the origin and evolution of sex chromosomes. However this plan of study has been hindered by the inability to identify the sex chromosome systems in the large number of species with cryptic, homomorphic sex chromosomes. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) is a critical enabling technology that can identify the sex chromosome systems in many species where traditional cytogenetic methods have failed. Using newly generated RAD-seq data from 12 gecko species, along with data from the literature, we reinterpret the evolution of sex-determining systems in lizards and snakes and test the hypothesis that sex chromosomes can routinely act as evolutionary traps. We uncovered between 17 and 25 transitions among gecko sex-determining systems. This is approximately one-half to two-thirds of the total number of transitions observed among all lizards and snakes. We ﬁnd support for the hypothesis that sex chromosome systems can readily become trap-like and show that adding even a small number of species from understudied clades can greatly enhance hypothesis testing in a model-based phylogenetic framework. RAD-seq will undoubtedly prove useful in evaluating other species for male or female heterogamety, particularly the majority of ﬁsh, amphibian, and reptile species that lack visibly heteromorphic sex chromosomes, and will signiﬁcantly accelerate the pace of biological discovery.},

	abstract = {A major barrier to evolutionary studies of sex determination and sex chromosomes has been a lack of information on the types of sex-determining mechanisms that occur among different species. This is particularly problematic in groups where most species lack visually heteromorphic sex chromosomes, such as ﬁsh, amphibians and reptiles, because cytogenetic analyses will fail to identify the sex chromosomes in these species. We describe the use of restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, or RAD-seq, to identify sex-speciﬁc molecular markers and subsequently determine whether a species has male or female heterogamety. To test the accuracy of this technique, we examined the lizard Anolis carolinensis. We performed RAD-seq on seven male and ten female A. carolinensis and found one male-speciﬁc molecular marker. Anolis carolinensis has previously been shown to possess male heterogamety and the recently published A. carolinensis genome facilitated the characterization of the sex-speciﬁc RADseq marker. We validated the male speciﬁcity of the new marker using PCR on additional individuals and also found that it is conserved in some other Anolis species. We discuss the utility of using RAD-seq to identify sex-determining mechanisms in other species with cryptic or homomorphic sex chromosomes and the implications for the evolution of male heterogamety in Anolis.},

Recently, the combined development of high-throughput sequencing and evolutionary network models offer new opportunities for phylogenetic inference under complex patterns of hybridization in the context of incomplete lineage sorting. Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) has been a popular sequencing technique for evolutionary reconstructions of close relatives in the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) era. However, the utility of RADseq data for the reconstruction of complex evolutionary networks has not been thoroughly discussed. Here, we used new molecular data collected from diploid perennial
            
            species using single-digest RADseq to reconstruct evolutionary networks from gene trees, an approach that is computationally tractable with datasets that include several species and complex patterns of hybridization. Our analyses revealed that complex network reconstructions from RADseq-derived gene trees were not robust under variations of the assembly parameters and filters. Filters to exclusively select loci with high phylogenetic information created datasets that retrieved the most anomalous topologies. Conversely, alternative clustering thresholds or filters on the number of samples
            
            locus affected the level of missing data but had a lower impact on networks. When most anomalous networks were discarded, all remaining network analyses consistently supported a hybrid origin for

The excess similarity is consistent with both recent admixture from Neanderthals into the ancestors of nonAfricans and subdivision in the ancestral population. Although later studies showed that there had been recent admixture, distinguishing between these two classes of models will be important in other situations, particularly when high-coverage genomes cannot be obtained for all populations. One of our two methods is based on the properties of the doubly conditioned frequency spectrum combined with the unconditional frequency spectrum. This method does not require a linkage map and can be used when there is relatively low coverage. The second method uses the extent of linkage disequilibrium among closely linked markers.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing of restriction site associated DNA, or RADseq, was introduced in 2008 as a rapid genotyping method that does not require prior marker development. Developed for linkage mapping, genome-wide association, and population genetic studies, RADseq was initially viewed as ill-suited to interspecific phylogenetic questions. However, since 2012, approximately a dozen RADseq phylogenetic studies have been published. These studies utilize a variety of bioinformatic methods to identify loci, estimate orthology, and assemble phylogenetic matrices, and software pipelines customized for phylogenetic analyses are being rapidly developed. The resulting data matrices tend to be large (sometimes megabases in total aligned length) but relatively incomplete, presenting analytical challenges. Empirical and simulated RADseq studies have demonstrated that RADseq is suitable for phylogenetic inquiries at relatively deep scales, in some cases at least 60 million years. Yet its real strengths may show up at the boundary between within- and among-species inquiries. As sequence-based data, RADseq can be mapped to genomic resources for purposes of alignment, gene identification, and investigating the genomic architecture of introgression and differentiation. Given the ease with which RADseq data can be generated, particularly in comparison to targeted enrichment methods that require prior identification of candidate loci, in the coming years we anticipate greater use of RADseq for phylogenetic inference and predict that methods of species-tree estimation and genomic analysis will increasingly accommodate its characteristically large, incomplete, genome-scale data matrices.},

Although recent studies have improved our understanding of adaptive introgression in widely distributed tree species, little is known about the dynamics of this process in populations at the margins of species ranges. We investigated the extent of introgression between three species of the genus Populus sect. Tacamahaca (P. balsamifera, P. angustifolia and P. trichocarpa) at the margins of their distributions in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States and Canada. Using genotyping by sequencing (GBS), we analysed {\textasciitilde} 83,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 296 individuals from 29 allopatric and sympatric populations of the three species. We found a trispecies hybrid complex present throughout the zone of range overlap, including early as well as advanced generation backcross hybrids, indicating recurrent gene flow in this hybrid complex. Using genomic cline analysis, we found evidence of non‐neutral patterns of introgression at 23\% of loci in hybrids, of which 47\% and 8\% represented excess ancestry from P. angustifolia and P. balsamifera, respectively. Gene ontology analysis suggested these genomic regions were enriched for genes associated with photoperiodic regulation, metal ion transport, maintenance of redox homeostasis and cell wall metabolites involved in regulation of seasonal dormancy. Our study demonstrates the role of adaptive introgression in a multispecies hybrid complex in rangeedge populations and has implications for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of adaptation in hybrid zones, especially at the margins of species distributions.},

Yet, despite being a topic of considerable interest, the identiﬁcation of hybrid individuals, and quantiﬁcation of the (un)certainty surrounding the identiﬁcations, remains difﬁcult. Unlike other programs that exist to identify hybrids based on genotypic information, NEWHYBRIDS is able to assign individuals to speciﬁc hybrid classes (e.g. F1, F2) because it makes use of patterns of gene inheritance within each locus, rather than just the proportions of gene inheritance within each individual. For each comparison and set of markers, multiple independent runs of each data set should be used to develop an estimate of the hybrid class assignment accuracy. The necessity of analysing multiple simulated data sets, constructed from large genomewide data sets, presents signiﬁcant computational challenges. To address these challenges, we present parallelnewhybrid, an R package designed to decrease user burden when undertaking multiple NEWHYBRIDS analyses. parallelnewhybrid does so by taking advantage of the parallel computational capabilities inherent in modern computers to efﬁciently and automatically execute separate NEWHYBRIDS runs in parallel. We show that parallelization of analyses using this package affords users several-fold reductions in time over a traditional serial analysis. parallelnewhybrid consists of an example data set, a README and three operating system-speciﬁc functions to execute parallel NEWHYBRIDS analyses on each of a computer’s c cores. parallelnewhybrid is freely available on the long-term software hosting site GITHUB (www.github.com/bwringe/parallelnewhybrid).},

	abstract = {Selection experiments in the wild have greatly aided our understanding of how selection shapes phenotypic diversity in natural populations. However, these experiments have been hindered by the fact that the traits most important to adaptation and speciation may be ﬁxed within populations. Experimental hybridization offers a means to circumvent this problem since crosses can be made between populations or species that differ for the trait of interest. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach, review results from published studies, and suggest strategies for future experiments. Advantages associated with this approach include the ability to ‘‘generate’’ variation for traits of interest, as well as the increased sensitivity of selection assays because of the wider range of trait values characteristic of segregating hybrids. Moreover, experimental hybridization can be extended to crosses between near-isogenic lines, allowing the effects of major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to be dissected in a well-deﬁned genetic background. Limitations include widespread linkage disequilibrium created by hybridization, possible cosegregation of hybrid incompatibilities, and the large number of variable traits likely to affect hybrid ﬁtnesses. Even with these limitations, this basic approach has been remarkably successful. We now know, for example, that many morphological differences between divergent populations or species are under selection and that the selection gradients may be surprisingly large. Also, small genetic changes in premating barriers may have large effects on assortative mating. With respect to discussions about the role of hybridization in evolution, experiments indicate that some hybrid trait combinations may be advantageous, particularly when the hybrid populations are placed in a new environment. Future studies seem likely to combine selection measurements with genetic mapping of the QTLs underlying the selected traits. Natural hybrid zones hold particular promise for these kinds of studies because the only experimental manipulation required is the removal of small amounts of tissue for genotyping.},

	abstract = {Background: Research over the last 10 years highlights the increasing importance of hybridization between species as a major force structuring the evolution of genomes and potentially providing raw material for adaptation by natural and/or sexual selection. Fueled by research in a few model systems where phenotypic hybrids are easily identified, research into hybridization and introgression (the flow of genes between species) has exploded with the advent of whole-genome sequencing and emerging methods to detect the signature of hybridization at the whole-genome or chromosome level. Amongst these are a general class of methods that utilize patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a tree as markers of hybridization. These methods have been applied to a variety of genomic systems ranging from butterflies to Neanderthals to detect introgression, however, when employed at a fine genomic scale these methods do not perform well to quantify introgression in small sample windows.
Results: We introduce a novel method to detect introgression by combining two widely used statistics: pairwise nucleotide diversity dxy and Patterson’s D. The resulting statistic, the distance fraction (df ), accounts for genetic distance across possible topologies and is designed to simultaneously detect and quantify introgression. We also relate our new method to the recently published fd and incorporate these statistics into the powerful genomics R-package PopGenome, freely available on GitHub (pievos101/PopGenome) and the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The supplemental material contains a wide range of simulation studies and a detailed manual how to perform the statistics within the PopGenome framework.
Conclusion: We present a new distance based statistic df that avoids the pitfalls of Patterson’s D when applied to small genomic regions and accurately quantifies the fraction of introgression (f ) for a wide range of simulation scenarios.},

We derive the analytic expectation of a test statistic, called the D statistic, which is sensitive to asymmetry under alternative demographic scenarios. We show that the D statistic is insensitive to some demographic assumptions such as ancestral population sizes and requires only the assumption that the ancestral populations were randomly mating. An important aspect of D statistics is that they can be used to detect archaic admixture even when no archaic sample is available. We explore the effect of sequencing error on the false-positive rate of the test for admixture, and we show how to estimate the proportion of archaic ancestry in the genomes of present-day populations. We also investigate a model of subdivision in ancestral populations that can result in D statistics that indicate recent admixture.},

	abstract = {Distinguishing between hybrid introgression and incomplete lineage sorting causing incongruence among gene trees in that they exhibit topological differences requires application of statistical approaches that are based on biologically relevant models. Such study is especially challenging in hybrid systems, where usual vectors mediating interspecific gene transfers hybrids with Mendelian heredity - are absent or unknown. Here we study a complex of hybridizing species, which are known to produce clonal hybrids, to discover how one of the species, Cobitis tanaitica, has achieved a pattern of mitonuclear mosaic genome over the whole geographic range. We appplied three distinct methods, including the method using solely the information on gene tree topologies, and found that the contrasting mito-nuclear signal might not have resulted from the retention of ancestral polymorphism. Instead, we found two signs of hybridization events related to C. tanaitica; one concerning nuclear gene flow and the other suggested mitochondrial capture. Interestingly, clonal inheritance (gynogenesis) of contemporary hybrids prevents genomic introgressions and non-clonal hybrids are either absent or too rare to be detected among European Cobitis. Our analyses therefore suggest that introgressive hybridizations are rather old episodes, mediated by previously existing hybrids whose inheritance was not entirely clonal. Cobitis complex thus supports the view that the type of resulting hybrids depends on a level of genomic divergence between sexual species.},

	abstract = {Introgression is now commonly reported in studies across the Tree of Life, aided by recent advancements in data collection and analysis. Nevertheless, researchers working with nonmodel species lacking reference genomes may be stymied by a mismatch between available resources and methodological demands. In this study, we demonstrate a fast and simple approach for inferring introgression using RADseq data, and apply it to a case study involving spiny lizards (Sceloporus) from northeastern México. First, we find evidence for recurrent mtDNA introgression between the two focal species based on patterns of mito‐nuclear discordance. We then test for nuclear introgression by exhaustively applying the “five‐taxon” D‐statistic (DFOIL) to all relevant individuals sampled for RADseq data. In our case, this exhaustive approach (dubbed “ExDFOIL”) entails testing up to {\textasciitilde}250,000 unique four‐taxon combinations of individuals across species. To facilitate use of this ExDFOIL approach, we provide scripts for many relevant tasks, including the selection of appropriate fourtaxon combinations, execution of DFOIL tests in parallel and visualization of introgression results in phylogenetic and geographic space. Using ExDFOIL, we find evidence for ancient introgression between the focal species. Furthermore, we reveal geographic variation in patterns of introgression that is consistent with patterns of mito‐nuclear discordance and with recurrent introgression. Overall, our study demonstrates that the combination of DFOIL and RADseq data can effectively detect introgression under a variety of sampling conditions (for individuals, populations and loci). Importantly, we also find evidence that batch‐specific error and linkage in RADseq data may mislead inferences of introgression under certain conditions.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic networks are rooted, directed, acyclic graphs that model reticulate evolutionary histories. Recently, statistical methods were devised for inferring such networks from either gene tree estimates or the sequence alignments of multiple unlinked loci. Bi-allelic markers, most notably single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), provide a powerful source of genome-wide data. In a recent paper, a method called SNAPP was introduced for statistical inference of species trees from unlinked bi-allelic markers. The generative process assumed by the method combined both a model of evolution for the bi-allelic markers, as well as the multispecies coalescent. A novel component of the method was a polynomial-time algorithm for exact computation of the likelihood of a fixed species tree via integration over all possible gene trees for a given marker. Here we report on a method for Bayesian inference of phylogenetic networks from bi-allelic markers. Our method significantly extends the algorithm for exact computation of phylogenetic network likelihood via integration over all possible gene trees. Unlike the case of species trees, the algorithm is no longer polynomial-time on all instances of phylogenetic networks. Furthermore, the method utilizes a reversible-jump MCMC technique to sample the posterior of phylogenetic networks given bi-allelic marker data. Our method has a very good performance in terms of accuracy and robustness as we demonstrate on simulated data, as well as a data set of multiple New Zealand species of the plant genus Ourisia (Plantaginaceae). We implemented the method in the publicly available, open-source PhyloNet software package.},

Although widespread, this procedure has the potential to alter downstream population genetic inferences and has received relatively little rigorous analysis. Here we use simulations and an empirical single nucleotide polymorphism data set to demonstrate the impacts of MAF thresholds on inference of population structure—often the first step in analysis of population genomic data. We find that model‐based inference of population structure is confounded when singletons are included in the alignment, and that both model‐based and multivariate analyses infer less distinct clusters when more stringent MAF cutoffs are applied. We propose that this behaviour is caused by the combination of a drop in the total size of the data matrix and by correlations between allele frequencies and mutational age. We recommend a set of best practices for applying MAF filters in studies seeking to describe population structure with genomic data.},

	abstract = {Comparing inferences among datasets generated using short read sequencing may provide insight into the concerted impacts of divergence, gene flow and selection across organisms, but comparisons are complicated by biases introduced during dataset assembly. Sequence similarity thresholds allow the de novo assembly of short reads into clusters of alleles representing different loci, but the resulting datasets are sensitive to both the similarity threshold used and to the variation naturally present in the organism under study. Thresholds that require high sequence similarity among reads for assembly (stringent thresholds) as well as highly variable species may result in datasets in which divergent alleles are lost or divided into separate loci (‘over-splitting’), whereas liberal thresholds increase the risk of paralogous loci being combined into a single locus (‘under-splitting’). Comparisons among datasets or species are therefore potentially biased if different similarity thresholds are applied or if the species differ in levels of within-lineage genetic variation. We examine the impact of a range of similarity thresholds on assembly of empirical short read datasets from populations of four different non-model bird lineages (species or species pairs) with different levels of genetic divergence. We find that, in all species, stringent similarity thresholds result in fewer alleles per locus than more liberal thresholds, which appears to be the result of high levels of over-splitting.},

	abstract = {transcriptome assembly is a powerful tool, widely used over the last decade for making evolutionary inferences. However, it relies on two implicit assumptions: that the assembled transcriptome is an unbiased representation of the underlying expressed transcriptome, and that expression estimates from the assembly are good, if noisy approximations of the relative abundance of expressed transcripts. Using publicly available data for model organisms, we demonstrate that, across assembly algorithms, species, and data sets, these assumptions are consistently violated. Bias exists at the nucleotide level, with genotyping error rates ranging from 30-83\%. As a result, diversity is underestimated in transcriptome assemblies, with consistent under-estimation of heterozygosity in all but the most inbred samples. Even at the gene level, expression estimates show wide deviations from map-to-reference estimates, and positive bias at lower expression levels. Standard filtering of transcriptome assemblies improves the robustness of gene expression estimates but leads to the loss of a meaningful number of protein coding genes, including many that are highly expressed. We demonstrate a computational method to partly alleviate noise and bias in expression estimates. Researchers should consider ways to minimize the impact of bias in transcriptome assemblies.},

Strategic errors can lead to improper data generation that has reduced power to answer biological questions. Here we present RADinitio, simulation software for the selection and optimization of RADseq experiments via the generation of sequencing data that behaves similarly to empirical sources. RADinitio provides an evolutionary simulation of populations, implementation of various RADseq protocols with customizable parameters, and thorough assessment of missing data. Using the software, we test its efficacy using different RAD protocols across several organisms, highlighting the importance of protocol selection on the magnitude and quality of data acquired. Additionally, we test the effects of RAD library preparation and sequencing on allelic dropout, observing that library preparation and sequencing often contributes more to missing alleles than population-level variation.},

Using the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 data set for 142 unrelated individuals, which includes genotypes for many rare variants, we study the following hypothesis: the difference in detected structure is the result of a “scale” effect; that is, rare variants are likely to be shared only locally (smaller scale), while common variants can be spread over longer distances. The result is similar to that of using kernel principal component analysis, as the bandwidth of the kernel is changed.

A Duplex Sequencing additionally exploits the fact that DNA is double-strand, with one strand reciprocally encoding the sequence information of its complement, and can eliminate nearly all sequencing errors by comparing the sequence of individually tagged amplicons derived from one strand of DNA with that of its complementary strand. This method reduces errors to fewer than one per ten million nucleotides sequenced.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technology has enabled the detection of rare genetic or somatic mutations and contributed to our understanding of disease progression and evolution. However, many next-generation sequencing technologies first rely on DNA amplification, via the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), as part of sample preparation workflows. Mistakes made during PCR appear in sequencing data and contribute to false mutations that can ultimately confound genetic analysis. In this report, a singlemolecule sequencing assay was used to comprehensively catalog the different types of errors introduced during PCR, including polymerase misincorporation, structureinduced template-switching, PCR-mediated recombination and DNA damage. In addition to well-characterized polymerase base substitution errors, other sources of error were found to be equally prevalent. PCR-mediated recombination by Taq polymerase was observed at the single-molecule level, and surprisingly found to occur as frequently as polymerase base substitution errors, suggesting it may be an underappreciated source of error for multiplex amplification reactions. Inverted repeat structural elements in lacZ caused polymerase template-switching between the top and bottom strands during replication and the frequency of these events were measured for different polymerases. For very accurate polymerases, DNA damage introduced during temperature cycling, and not polymerase base substitution errors, appeared to be the major contributor toward mutations occurring in amplification products. In total, we analyzed PCR products at the single-molecule level and present here a more complete picture of the types of mistakes that occur during DNA amplification.},

Accurate and complete quantiﬁcation of a DNA polymerase’s error spectrum is challenging because errors are rare and difﬁcult to detect. We report a highthroughput sequencing assay to map in vitro DNA replication errors at the single-molecule level. Unlike previous methods, our assay is able to rapidly detect a large number of polymerase errors at base resolution over any template substrate without quantiﬁcation bias. To overcome the high error rate of highthroughput sequencing, our assay uses a barcoding strategy in which each replication product is tagged with a unique nucleotide sequence before ampliﬁcation. This allows multiple sequencing reads of the same product to be compared so that sequencing errors can be found and removed. We demonstrate the ability of our assay to characterize the average error rate, error hotspots and lesion bypass ﬁdelity of several DNA polymerases.},

To evaluate these platforms for this application, we analyzed human sequence generated by the Roche 454, Illumina GA, and the ABI SOLiD technologies for the same 260 kb in four individuals.
Results: Local sequence characteristics contribute to systematic variability in sequence coverage ({\textgreater}100-fold difference in per-base coverage), resulting in patterns for each NGS technology that are highly correlated between samples. A comparison of the base calls to 88 kb of overlapping ABI 3730xL Sanger sequence generated for the same samples showed that the NGS platforms all have high sensitivity, identifying {\textgreater}95\% of variant sites. At high coverage, depth base calling errors are systematic, resulting from local sequence contexts; as the coverage is lowered additional 'random sampling' errors in base calling occur.
Conclusions: Our study provides important insights into systematic biases and data variability that need to be considered when utilizing NGS platforms for population targeted sequencing studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Estimation of allele frequency is of fundamental importance in population genetic analyses and in association mapping. In most studies using next-generation sequencing, a cost effective approach is to use medium or low-coverage data (e.g., {\textless} 15X). However, SNP calling and allele frequency estimation in such studies is associated with substantial statistical uncertainty because of varying coverage and high error rates.
Results: We evaluate a new maximum likelihood method for estimating allele frequencies in low and medium coverage next-generation sequencing data. The method is based on integrating over uncertainty in the data for each individual rather than first calling genotypes. This method can be applied to directly test for associations in case/control studies. We use simulations to compare the likelihood method to methods based on genotype calling, and show that the likelihood method outperforms the genotype calling methods in terms of: (1) accuracy of allele frequency estimation, (2) accuracy of the estimation of the distribution of allele frequencies across neutrally evolving sites, and (3) statistical power in association mapping studies. Using real re-sequencing data from 200 individuals obtained from an exon-capture experiment, we show that the patterns observed in the simulations are also found in real data.
Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest that association mapping and estimation of allele frequencies should not be based on genotype calling in low to medium coverage data. Furthermore, if genotype calling methods are used, it is usually better not to filter genotypes based on the call confidence score.},

RAD-Seq is a technique characterized by the sequencing of speciﬁc loci along the genome, that is widely employed in the ﬁeld of evolutionary biology since it allows to exploit variants (mainly SNPs) information from entire populations at a reduced cost. Common RAD dedicated tools, as STACKS or IPyRAD, are based on all-versus-all read comparisons, which require consequent time and computing resources. Based on the variant caller DiscoSnp, initially designed for shotgun sequencing, DiscoSnp-RAD avoids this pitfall as variants are detected by exploring the De Bruijn Graph built from all the read datasets. We tested the implementation on RAD data from 259 specimens of Chiastocheta ﬂies, morphologically assigned to 7 species. All individuals were successfully assigned to their species using both STRUCTURE and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction. Moreover, identiﬁed variants succeeded to reveal a within species structuration and the existence of two populations linked to their geographic distributions. Furthermore, our results show that DiscoSnp-RAD is at least one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tools. The overall results show that DiscoSnp-RAD is suitable to identify variants from RAD data, and stands out from other tools due to his completely diﬀerent principle, making it signiﬁcantly faster, in particular on large datasets.},

Here we conducted a genome scan of nucleotide diversity and differentiation in natural populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We used Illumina-sequenced RAD tags to identify and type over 45,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 100 individuals from two oceanic and three freshwater populations. Overall estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation among populations confirm the biogeographic hypothesis that large panmictic oceanic populations have repeatedly given rise to phenotypically divergent freshwater populations. Genomic regions exhibiting signatures of both balancing and divergent selection were remarkably consistent across multiple, independently derived populations, indicating that replicate parallel phenotypic evolution in stickleback may be occurring through extensive, parallel genetic evolution at a genome-wide scale. Some of these genomic regions co-localize with previously identified QTL for stickleback phenotypic variation identified using laboratory mapping crosses. In addition, we have identified several novel regions showing parallel differentiation across independent populations. Annotation of these regions revealed numerous genes that are candidates for stickleback phenotypic evolution and will form the basis of future genetic analyses in this and other organisms. This study represents the first high-density SNP–based genome scan of genetic diversity and differentiation for populations of threespine stickleback in the wild. These data illustrate the complementary nature of laboratory crosses and population genomic scans by confirming the adaptive significance of previously identified genomic regions, elucidating the particular evolutionary and demographic history of such regions in natural populations, and identifying new genomic regions and candidate genes of evolutionary significance.},

	abstract = {Haploid high quality reference genomes are an important resource in genomic research projects. A consequence is that DNA fragments carrying the reference allele will be more likely to map successfully, or receive higher quality scores. This reference bias can have effects on downstream population genomic analysis when heterozygous sites are falsely considered homozygous for the reference allele. In palaeogenomic studies of human populations, mapping against the human reference genome is used to identify endogenous human sequences. Ancient DNA studies usually operate with low sequencing coverages and fragmentation of DNA molecules causes a large proportion of the sequenced fragments to be shorter than 50 bp—reducing the amount of accepted mismatches, and increasing the probability of multiple matching sites in the genome. These ancient DNA specific properties are potentially exacerbating the impact of reference bias on downstream analyses, especially since most studies of ancient human populations use pseudohaploid data, i.e. they randomly sample only one sequencing read per site. We show that reference bias is pervasive in published ancient DNA sequence data of prehistoric humans with some differences between individual genomic regions. We illustrate that the strength of reference bias is negatively correlated with fragment length. Most genomic regions we investigated show little to no mapping bias but even a small proportion of sites with bias can impact analyses of those particular loci or slightly skew genome-wide estimates. Therefore, reference bias has the potential to cause minor but significant differences in the results of downstream analyses such as population allele sharing, heterozygosity estimates and estimates of archaic ancestry. These spurious results highlight how important it is to be aware of these technical artifacts and that we need strategies to mitigate the effect. Therefore, we suggest some post-mapping filtering strategies to resolve reference bias which help to reduce its impact substantially.},

	abstract = {Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have dramatically revolutionised research in many fields of genetics. The ability to sequence many individuals from one or multiple populations at a genomic scale has greatly enhanced population genetics studies and made it a data-driven discipline. Recently, researchers have proposed statistical modelling to address genotyping uncertainty associated with NGS data. However, an ongoing debate is whether it is more beneficial to increase the number of sequenced individuals or the per-sample sequencing depth for estimating genetic variation. Through extensive simulations, I assessed the accuracy of estimating nucleotide diversity, detecting polymorphic sites, and predicting population structure under different experimental scenarios. Results show that the greatest accuracy for estimating population genetics parameters is achieved by employing a large sample size, despite single individuals being sequenced at low depth. Under some circumstances, the minimum sequencing depth for obtaining accurate estimates of allele frequencies and to identify polymorphic sites is 2X , where both alleles are more likely to have been sequenced. On the other hand, inferences of population structure are more accurate at very large sample sizes, even with extremely low sequencing depth. This all points to the conclusion that under various experimental scenarios, in cost-limited population genetics studies, large sample sizes at low sequencing depth are desirable to achieve high accuracy. These findings will help researchers design their experimental set-ups and guide further investigation on the effect of protocol design for genetic research.},

	abstract = {With read lengths of currently up to 2 × 300 bp, high throughput and low sequencing costs Illumina’s MiSeq is becoming one of the most utilized sequencing platforms worldwide. The platform is manageable and affordable even for smaller labs. This enables quick turnaround on a broad range of applications such as targeted gene sequencing, metagenomics, small genome sequencing and clinical molecular diagnostics. However, Illumina error proﬁles are still poorly understood and programs are therefore not designed for the idiosyncrasies of Illumina data. A better knowledge of the error patterns is essential for sequence analysis and vital if we are to draw valid conclusions. Studying true genetic variation in a population sample is fundamental for understanding diseases, evolution and origin. We conducted a large study on the error patterns for the MiSeq based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data. We tested state-of-the-art library preparation methods for amplicon sequencing and showed that the library preparation method and the choice of primers are the most signiﬁcant sources of bias and cause distinct error patterns. Furthermore we tested the efﬁciency of various error correction strategies and identiﬁed quality trimming (Sickle) combined with error correction (BayesHammer) followed by read overlapping (PANDAseq) as the most successful approach, reducing substitution error rates on average by 93\%.},

	abstract = {Genotype calling plays important roles in population-genomic studies, which have been greatly accelerated by sequencing technologies. To take full advantage of the resultant information, we have developed maximum-likelihood (ML) methods for calling genotypes from high-throughput sequencing data. As the statistical uncertainties associated with sequencing data depend on depths of coverage, we have developed two types of genotype callers. One approach is appropriate for low-coverage sequencing data, and incorporates population-level information on genotype frequencies and error rates pre-estimated by an ML method. Performance evaluation using computer simulations and human data shows that the proposed framework yields less biased estimates of allele frequencies and more accurate genotype calls than current widely used methods. Another type of genotype caller applies to high-coverage sequencing data, requires no prior genotype-frequency estimates, and makes no assumption on the number of alleles at a polymorphic site. Using computer simulations, we determine the depth of coverage necessary to accurately characterize polymorphisms using this second method. We applied the proposed method to high-coverage (mean 18·) sequencing data of 83 clones from a population of Daphnia pulex. The results show that the proposed method enables conservative and reasonably powerful detection of polymorphisms with arbitrary numbers of alleles. We have extended the proposed method to the analysis of genomic data for polyploid organisms, showing that calling accurate polyploid genotypes requires much higher coverage than diploid genotypes.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary biologists typically represent clines as spatial gradients in a univariate character (or a principal-component axis) whose mean changes as a function of location along a transect spanning an environmental gradient or ecotone. This univariate approach may obscure the multivariate nature of phenotypic evolution across a landscape. Clines might instead be plotted as a series of vectors in multidimensional morphospace, connecting sequential geographic sites. We present a model showing that clines may trace nonlinear paths that arc through morphospace rather than elongating along a single major trajectory. Arcing clines arise because different characters diverge at different rates or locations along a geographic transect. We empirically conﬁrm that some clines arc through morphospace, using morphological data from threespine stickleback sampled along eight independent transects from lakes down their respective outlet streams. In all eight clines, successive vectors of lake-stream divergence ﬂuctuate in direction and magnitude in trait space, rather than pointing along a single phenotypic axis. Most clines exhibit surprisingly irregular directions of divergence as one moves downstream, although a few clines exhibit more directional arcs through morphospace. Our results highlight the multivariate complexity of clines that cannot be captured with the traditional graphical framework. We discuss hypotheses regarding the causes, and implications, of such arcing multivariate clines.},

Recently, the importance of Dobzhansky-type models in evolutionary studies has been reemphasized by Gavrilets (1997a) and Gavrilets and Gravner (1997) who argue that the existence of "ridges" of well-fit genotypes connecting reproductively isolated genotypes is actually a general property of multidimensional adaptive landscapes. Using rigorous techniques and numerical simulations, I analyze clines in the frequencies of selected and neutral alleles maintained by a balance of migration and Dobzhansky-type epistatic selection acting on two diallelic loci. I show that Dobzhansky-type epistatic selection can build up a very strong barrier to neutral gene flow. I describe properties of clines that are indicative of Dobzhansky-type selection.},
