\section{Introduction}

How does an MSA model compare to BC model as the number and length of loci
change?

When we have multi-locus sequence data, should we analyze all the data under
a biallelic-character model, or only keep (at most) one site per locus?

How do MSA and BC models compare in term of robustness to data-acquistion
biases?
BC can be very sensitive \citep{Oaks2018ecoevolity}.
Will MSA fair better?
Information from each site under a BC model is the counts of alleles.
Thus, it's not surprising these models are sensitive when these counts are off.
BC gleans information from many sites to directly inform the species
tree by integrating out the gene trees; we have very little information
about any of the gene trees.
In comparison, information from aligned sequences of linked sites can
potentially contain much more information about the underlying gene tree.
Thus, if an acquistion bias causes some tips to be missing, the
information in the gene tree and branch lengths from the remaning
sequences might allow us to recover.
